i cracked what appears to be the final document about the trojan
deployment and i think i have an idea about how to deal with it and
with the flag day associates the principal weakness of any system
like the one they have installed is the need to provide large
quantities of power the fda came up with an ingenious solution but
it is very vulnerable special forces could take it out for us but
that would tell the fda that we have cracked their ciphers so instead
i suggest we let them destroy trojan for us we will need cooperation
from the omani government an armed fighter jet and the flight control
systems from a drone

meanwhile we need to ensure two things one that we do not send critical
information across the bab-al-mandab strait and two that we use a
noncritical key generation protocol on that channel given the level
of commitment the fda have shown in developing this plan i am sure
that they will reinstate the power supply within a few months but with
luck they will not guess that we know about it and we will put it out
of business for long enough to come up with a plan of our own to exploit it

in the meantime we now know that their highest-security communications
are encrypted using a cadenus cipher so we can start hunting through the
database for other intercepts we can crack this may be the breakthrough
we have been looking for in the fight against the fda let's not screw
it up

all the best
