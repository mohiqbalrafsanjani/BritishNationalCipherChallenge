we completed the survey and you are not going to believe what we found
behind the false bulkhead in the stern there was a large pumping station
connected to a number of sea-facing outlets it looks like a scuttling
valve system similar to the ones used on u-boats in world war two i can't
understand why they would go to so much effort when they could have
scuttled her at any time with a small quantity of plastic explosive

the team back at nsa have run some analytics on the remaining text files
we extracted from the servers on board these ciphers are going to be
pretty hard to crack the attached report has frequency analysis matching
usual english text so we can assume that the sender was a native speaker

did you have any thoughts on what the nautilus system might have been or
what it was for
