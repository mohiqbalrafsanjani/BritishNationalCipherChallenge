phase four

the decks were cleared by two am and the mounting plates were prepared
and measured mounting points were assembled by four am though owing to
the approaching dawn deployment of seabird was postponed and we embarked
on stage two of seahorse assembly with camouflage plates installed we
set to cruising in case of air or sea surveillance following standard
routes to avoid suspicion monitoring of airwaves gave no cause for
concern but we have raised security levels and are using a column
transposition cipher for this communication with keyword seabird
future comms will rely on even more security tonight will be used for
more sea trials of the nautilus system while the assembly crew rest and
the survey team carry out further mapping we will resume the seahorse
build at dusk tomorrow
