phase six

seahorse operated exactly as planned with good forward visibility at
the trial depths the crew managed several tasks requiring concentration
and dexterity and we plan to run a full test overnight on dummy cables
dropped from the ship the software seems to be operating as designed
but there are still bugs in the firmware that need ironing out before
we deploy the collective is working full-time to hunt them down and
remove them though we are all getting tired mistakes are easy to make
and could be fatal time is no longer on our side though and we are still
planning to launch the final phase of the operation in three days time
