phase three

the nautilus system was fully tested last night with complete success
we sailed within four hundred metres of the target and monitored all
radio traffic for two hours with no sign that we were being watched
or were even noticed we then conducted a full radar sweep of the area
and found three dead spots where we could work on the ship without
detection

as planned we converted the two adjacent empty containers in the middle
of the stack into a large workshop area and carried out a full inspection
drill now even if we are boarded our work should remain undetected

we retrieved seahorse from the third container and carried out stage
one of the assembly
