i cracked that last message for myself and noticed something really
odd the text said it was encrypted using a column transposition with
keyword seabird but it was enciphered using a railfence cipher i can
only assume that the text we retrieved was an archive of the original
message reencrypted for safety whoever the flag day associates are
they have a pretty sophisticated operation if they are filing messages
like this more like one of the major terrorist groups than the usual
hacker collective

the tech guys took a look at the aerial from the boat and they tell me
that it is a drag wire usually used to communicate with a submarine
when submerged it carried an acoustic transducer array as well as a
shortwave transmitter and listening gear

one thing that puzzles me now is why we were allowed to find the ship
floating at all surely they must have planned to sink her using the
scuttling equipment otherwise what was it for they seem too smart to
leave it floating for us to find any thoughts

ps just before i sent this the cipher clerk came in with a decrypt
of the attached columnar transposition keyword has length six think
it answers some of our questions about the nautilus system
