report on the trojan project

having drugged the crew we were able to take the ship with essentially
no resistance the crew were handed to the somali pirates at the deep-water
rendezvous as planned and we began the survey just after midnight the
radar showed an approaching vessel which our database identified as a
coast guard cutter we headed south to avoid detection with all ship lights
off we then completed the survey in the new location after dawn with the
listening post installed we began assembling the equipment for phase two
of the operation keeping a watch for further patrols in the sky and on
the water
