the last message told us a lot the scuttling equipment is designed to
pump water in and out of the vessel like a submarine dive control but
clearly they weren't planning to turn a container ship into a sub this
ship is a large-scale version of something i have seen in the caribbean
drug runners use a similar technique to get below radar coverage for
in-shore runs sinking the vessel so that the deck remains just below the
wave tops the fda pirates seem more interested in staying away from shore
but getting close enough to track and record electronic communications
without detection i am guessing this scuttling system is what they call
nautilus in their log but i am still baffled by the references to seahorse

the next page of the log looks harder to crack but the cipher clerk tells
me it is a hill cipher and that they must have been in a hurry or have
been enciphering by hand since they just used a two-by-two matrix

actually we have been pretty lax with our security and i think the next
message i send will use a vigenere cipher given that we are using secure
cables i don't think we have too much to worry about so i will keep the
keyword short say three characters

more later
