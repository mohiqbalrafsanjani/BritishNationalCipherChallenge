dear mark

things are a lot clearer now i flew out to inspect the ship myself
last night and took a good look around the reason the ship was not
scuttled was that the valves had jammed it looks like the driftwood
was pulled into the mechanism and blocked the inlet presumably the
crew had already abandoned the vessel which was lucky for us without
the ship we would have had no idea that the fda had been operating
in these waters

seahorse is no longer a mystery the cutaway on the starboard side
cleared an area of around five meters square with a distinctive
pattern of bolts fastened to reinforced deck plates i saw something
like this on a sub rescue mission a couple of years ago when they
fitted a local ship with a jury-rigged inspection system the deck
plates can carry a crane designed to deploy an rova remote-operated
vehicle designed for undersea operations

i was already concerned about the reference to the cables in the last
part of the fda log but the next section has me really worried it is
encrypted with a more secure modified amsco transposition cipher and
tells us what they were really up to

what i don't understand is how the whole assembly is powered the sort
of computing they must be doing is really intensive and would burn
through a battery in days in that time their intercept might not catch
anything useful but they can hardly have hijacked a local socket in
the middle of the ocean

can you get me a chart showing the deep-sea cables in the region i don't
imagine the us will be a problem but it may need some diplomacy to get
the full coverage maps from the omani government if i am right it is in
their best interests to play along we all have a lot to lose here
