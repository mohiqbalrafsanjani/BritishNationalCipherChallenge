phase five

seahorse is ready for trials and the nautilus system is
fully functional we engaged the mechanism and lowered the deck to
three feet above sea level approaching the shore by the radar station
at all times signals from their communications were monitored and no
sign was given that our approach had been monitored or even noticed
we backed off the deck was raised by two feet and the approach
attempted again once more our incursion was unnoticed overnight we
conducted a range of tests and mapped the radar coverage on three
separate occasions there seems to have been a flurry of activity
and our modeling suggests that the ship's masts may have triggered
brief alarms on all occasions the automatic dive systems cut in
correctly lowering the decks to sea level and the alarms were
cancelled the seahorse deployment system will be fully mounted
tonight and we will conduct a battery of tests on the deployment
and emergency recovery systems over the next two nights assuming
that sea and air traffic remains low
