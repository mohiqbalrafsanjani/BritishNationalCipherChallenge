harry,

you asked me about the flag day associates. they are a trans-national
hacking group dedicated to the overthrow of western capitalism. they
have been implicated in several major protests, including an attempt
to take over the uk national grid, attacks on reservoir systems and
interference in bank trading networks.

it looks like the fda carried out fairly extensive modifications to
the ship. they did a good job too. we hadn't noticed the added bulkheads
until we compared the layout with the plans from lloyd's register.
they seem to be there to add rigidity, though there is one additional
panel at the stern that doesn't fit the pattern and we will be removing
that tonight to see what it is there for. we would have done it this
afternoon but decided we should conduct our own hull survey in case
there is a booby trap.
