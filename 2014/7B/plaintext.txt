phase seven

we approached the cable junction under cover of night with nautilus
at an elevation of three feet towing seahorse to starboard comms
interception showed that we remained undetected and seahorse was
deployed at operating depth the various layers of armoured protection
were removed from the cable and as expected once the steel jacket was
removed the other layers provided little resistance the divers entered
the water and cut into the core to insert the optical repeaters linking
them back to the man-in-the-middle unit which was powered up and fully
tested initial tests showed that it was operating as expected and three
keys have already been recovered from the omani transmissions with
daylight approaching the remaining tests were postponed for the following
night and the ship returned to deeper waters where it remained at low
deck height the divers were left at seahorse to decompress slowly and
will be recovered tomorrow once the final tests have been concluded
