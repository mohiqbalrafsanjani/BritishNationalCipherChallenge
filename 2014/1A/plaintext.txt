mark,

thanks for bringing me in on this one, seems like a fascinating case.

i have three questions:
why would the flag day associates want a ship?
why would they want this ship?
why would they want this ship now?

having read the attached document i suspect that the answers are all
related to the question of what exactly she and her flag day associate
crew were trying to survey.

i am guessing that you already checked out the onboard gps system for
information about her movements, but if you did find anything i would
be fascinated to hear about it. in the meantime i am pretty sure that
you know more about the flag day associates than you have told me, so
a briefing would be much appreciated.

all the best,

harry
