trinity,

i hadn't realised quite how much danger you were in until you told
me about hooke approaching you. almost certainly he has been watching
you closely, and even if you escaped the watchers he will know that
you are on the run. he is certain to assume that you have discovered
something and he may even guess that, to steal from mark twain, "the
rumors of my death have been greatly exaggerated". it can't be helped,
we needed to get you safe. it is so strange, the one thing i never
liked about newton was his irrational dislike and ill treatment of
his contemporary hooke. now here i am on the run from his namesake.
still the association suggests a rich supply of keywords for ciphers!
the big question is whether hooke wants the quantum secret to be
suppressed or sold. if all he wants is silence then the cheapest way
to get it is to kill us both. if he wants what we know, then he needs
to keep us alive a little longer and we may be able to bargain with
him or his bosses.
