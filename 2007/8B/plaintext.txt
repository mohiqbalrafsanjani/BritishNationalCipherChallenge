Hooke,

We know all about your time in the middle east. Let's just say that a
friend of a friend hangs around with someone who heard a little more
about your past than you would like. It seems that there is more than
one national intelligence agency with an interest in you. In fact, only
one has much evidence, you will be glad to hear, since they managed you
as an agent at the time.

It would be a pity if another agency you spied on were to see the evidence,
but you will be glad to hear that they are unlikely to get it, unless they
look on the web, of course. In fact, by now they probably have. We sent
them the web link before sending you this message. We would both have loved
to have been there when you read that sentence. The look on your face must
have been priceless.

You don't need to panic yet. We took the liberty of encrypting the evidence
of your double-dealing with, as you might guess, a one-time pad. Without
the key your enemies can read nothing, and you are a free man. On the other
hand, we have made sure that if anything happens to either of us, then the
key will be delivered to them. As you can see, your future, and of course
our own, is in your hands. Trinity will make all the further arrangements,
but i am sure we can come to a mutually satisfying agreement.

Ben
