you had better have a good explanation for all this. the house i
shared with the other students was no great beauty, but this place
makes it look palatial. anyway the street outside is busy making
it easy to come and go in a crowd, and no-one i know lives around
here so i am pretty much anonymous. i thought i was being followed
at first, but i lost them somewhere at the station. the steganography
trick was pretty cool, but i’m afraid i left the card in my office so
if anyone is spying on me they will know what’s up. i figure the caesar
shift you used on it won’t hold them up for long. perhaps you should
use something a bit more sophisticated next time. an affine shift cipher
maybe? i have a lot of questions and you had better start answering
them straight away. one other thing, a man called hooke has been asking
questions about you.

trinity.
