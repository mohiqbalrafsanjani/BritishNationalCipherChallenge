ben's idea is a good one and i think i can make it better i can use a
draft of the book already known to hooke and claim that it contains
the encrypted message if i tell him that the cipher is a one-time pad
and that i found the otp still hidden on the hd of ben's laptop then
i can give him the first few letters of the key to convince him the
big advantage of an otp is that i can make the book decrypt as any
message i like by cooking up the right key hooke is smart but he is
no cryptographer and he probably won't see past the deceit have to
hope not any way or i am dead the real question is how to neutralise
him as a threat i spent a sleepless night wondering about it

something i turned up in my research on hooke is nagging at me and i
can't think what it is my cousin has a friend in israeli intelligence
maybe he can help

ben has really stepped up the security this time double-encrypted with
a substitution and a transposition stage
