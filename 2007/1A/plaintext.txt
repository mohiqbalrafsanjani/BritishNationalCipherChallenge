i don't know where ben got the technology for the amazing disappearing
picture on the postcard, it is pretty high tech and tells me this really
is serious. because of his work on cryptography he hangs around with
people on the edge of the spy world and maybe one of them gave it to him.
the rather easy cipher he used on the postcard is worrying, but if ben was
in a hurry maybe he didn't have time for something more serious. he might
have been relying on the steganography for security and perhaps he wanted
me to be able to decrypt the message easily once i had found it. anyway it
looks like he might not be the only one on the run now. if what he says is
true, i have to go underground too.
