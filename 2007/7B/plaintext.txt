i still don't see how you plan to keep hooke off our back in the long
term but maybe i am worrying unnecessarily everything else you have
done seems to have worked and i guess you will figure out a way whatever
happens i think my career as a research mathematician is over i can't
see how i can ever tell anyone about faking my death without blowing
open the whole story your career on the other hand could be just
beginning i have a friend in honolulu who i trust and if you want i
could contact him it would be a good place for you and he usually has
a few postdoc positions available on the other hand you probably won't
be any safer there than here if your plan goes wrong

it is up to you what you want to do with the stuff about breaking the
quantum code there is a whole load of maths to be done and as i said i
probably won't be doing it i have an eye on an apple orchard in cambridge
given our experience with hooke i'm not sure it will ever be safe to work
on it but if you want to try i have contacts who may be interested in
helping you your best bet might be at cheltenham gchq would certainly
be interested it's a bit different from the sun surf and sand in hawaii
but the work is interesting and they are pretty good at looking after
their own

any way there are still things to be done
do be careful
