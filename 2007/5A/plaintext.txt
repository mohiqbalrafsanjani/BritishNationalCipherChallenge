ben is right and there is a lot at stake here but doing nothing is
not an option i think he is right about hooke too i googled hooke
and let's just say he has an interesting history not much about him
recently i guess as he grew more successful he learned to be discreet
but his early ventures didn't all go smoothly there was one strange
incident that caught my eye with a middle-east internet publishing
start-up the eight-fold way which went under in the nineties dot com
bubble he had borrowed millions to set it up but came out of it with
no personal losses as far as i can tell he is a smart cookie and
pretty tough too but bankers are tougher and something about this
smells wrong i wonder if he was working for intelligence at the time
and they bailed him out but this is just a guess if he did make
contacts in that world he could be banking on a quick sale if he can
get hold of ben's idea

interesting looking at ben's message it looks like he has been thinking
about the eight-fold way too
