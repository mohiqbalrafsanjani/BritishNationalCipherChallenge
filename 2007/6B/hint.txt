[Harry says] Time for a hint (or, more accurately, a tutorial on cracking 6B).

Challenge 6B is technically the hardest yet. As Trinity says in part 6A it is double encrypted. In this case it has been encrypted with a substitution cipher then jumbled up with a transposition. In fact it doesn't matter which order these two were done in, it could have been jumbled first then Ben could have applied the substitution second. If you look at the frequency distribution of the cipher text characters you will see that no one letter stands out as much more common than the others, this tells you that he can't have used a standard substitution like a keyword cipher but must have used something polyalphabetic like the Vigenere cipher. You might want to look it up online and in our Teachers' Pack. The key to breaking it is to figure out or guess the length of the keyword used. It is likely to be a small prime, and, for reasons I won't go into here, is also likely to divide the gap length between repeats of triples of letters (you will see why if you read up about the Vigenere) so the first step you should take is to look for repeated triples of characters in the text and write down how many characters there are from the start of the first triple to the last character before the start of its repeat. Do this wherever you see a triple repeating. (You could try couples of letters instead, its up to you.) Then look for common factors. The most common factor is likely to be the length of the keyword. You can use this to divide the text up into pieces. If the keylength is seven the first piece consists of the first, the eighth, the fifteenth letters and so on, and the second consists of the second, the ninth, the sixteenth, ...
