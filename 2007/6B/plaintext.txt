trinity

here is the text you can use to catch hooke there isn't enough maths
here for him to use it but it agrees with what i told him before and
should be juicy enough to draw him in

i have been a fan of newton since i was a kid he built a whole theory
from the simple idea that as far as gravity goes the moon and an apple
are treated just the same it is so simple so elegant i couldn't resist
the attraction of newton's gravity just like the moon and the apple i
guess

any way while i was trying to finish the proofs of my book i decided
i needed to get away for a few days and decided to visit woolsthorpe
manor i have never been before i usually go to trinity college when
i want to think about newton i was sitting under a tree when a gust
of wind caught one of the highest apples on the tree and i watched it
fall almost in slow motion towards me i had time to throw up a hand
to catch the fruit and that is when it hit me not the apple i caught
it in time the idea the apple in the tree is like a quantum particle
that has not yet decided on its state eventually it will be disturbed
in this case by the wind and it will fall to a definite position on
the ground but until that experiment is done it is pretty hard to say
where it will end up but i caught it before it landed only just but i
could tell you pretty much where it would have landed if i hadn't been
there just underneath my hand but it hadn't landed there not yet and
i could easily reach up and stick it back in the tree of course the
analogy breaks down here because i couldn't really put the apple and
the tree back together but the idea was still there may be it would
be possible to take partial quantum measurements to watch where the
particle might land if we carried out a full measurement without fully
collapsing the quantum wave and maybe we could do this and then stick
the wave back together and if we could then just maybe we could crack
or at least weaken quantum ciphers
