trinity,

the fact that you are reading this means something has gone wrong. no time
or space here for details, but you are in grave danger. my work on quantum
codes and ciphers took an unexpected turn one day under the apple trees in
woolsthorpe, and like a fool i mentioned it to the wrong man. now he, or
someone he works for, wants me dead. since you have been working in the same
field they may want you dead too. you need to disappear as quickly and quietly
as you can. as soon as you are safe place an ad in the advertiser with the
message "the apple is in the basket" and a mobile number where i can reach
you. i will txt further instructions. i am so sorry you are involved in this.

ben.
