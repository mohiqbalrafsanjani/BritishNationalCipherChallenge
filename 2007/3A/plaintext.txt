if ben really has found a way to crack quantum encryption he is in
dead trouble, and i mean dead. he obviously thinks i am too, and
the more i think about it, the more i think he is right. he never
was very worldly so the fact that he can see it means it must be
very obvious. i spent the last three months editing a book of ben's
collected works. this guy hooke approached me about it at the funeral
and it seemed a good idea at the time - something to keep me busy
until the department could sort out a new supervisor for me, but
thinking back on it there was something a bit creepy about him
approaching me during the burial itself. he said it would be a fitting
memorial to ben, but now it is obvious that he hoped i would tell him
if ben had left any evidence of his discovery. i guess this had better
be the last time i use an affine shift. i texted ben to suggest a
keyword substitution for his message to me. maybe i'll do the same
next time.
