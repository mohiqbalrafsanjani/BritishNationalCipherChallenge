things are changing from opaque to murky and i think i begin to see
what we need to do hooke is clearly involved but what i dont know is
whether he is working alone or with someone else there are plenty of
candidates the russian mafia a national security agency a major
computing outfit maybe one of the banks one thing is sure i dont want
to sit here and wait for them to find me on the other hand i dont know
how to go about finding them i guess it is still possible that ben was
wrong and there is no flaw in quantum encryption maybe that would be
the best outcome for me no flaw means no reason to risk trying to
silence me i could turn up with a fake tan and say i have been surfing
in newquay for the last two weeks and this whole thing could just blow
over on the other hand it wont fix things for ben hooke wont want to
leave that thread dangling and since ben is already dead there will be
little risk for hooke in trying to finish the job ben's codes are
getting more sophisticated this code is pat and i might use it myself
from time to time
