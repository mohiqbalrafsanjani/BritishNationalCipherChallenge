Trinity,

I think I have a way to bait the trap. We have to assume that Hooke
is working alone. If I am wrong about this we are probably dead anyway.
If he has hired hit-men, we might still be alright if we can take him
out of the game. They would have no paymaster and no reason to stay
involved, but to get at him we need a way to convince him that you have
something he needs. You have to convince Hooke that you have deciphered
a hidden message in the draft of my book which describes the quantum
crack. If he believes you have it, that it is securely encrypted and
that you are the only one with the key, then you should be safe. From
there we need some way of neutralising him as a threat, more on that
later. Of course it puts you at considerable risk, but as you say,
doing nothing is not an option.
