i arranged to meet hooke at the harbour in southampton i wanted
somewhere open that i knew well and i had spent a lot of time
there in the summer hanging around the boats the meeting went
well and hooke seemed reasonably relaxed relaxed was good i was
pretty sure he was armed and didn't fancy sitting less than a
meter from an itchy trigger finger

i was right about his knowledge of ciphers he had heard of one-
time pads but didn't know much about them only that they can be
pretty much uncrackable that just made him more interested when
i showed him the secret message in ben's book i deciphered the
first paragraph for him while he watched i even got him to read
out the key string i almost laughed at his concentration but
maybe that was my nerves any way he took the bait he promises
to lay off me in exchange for the rest of the key of course once
i give him the key all bets are off unless part two of my plan
works but after the message from the middle east last night i am
feeling a lot more confident about that

ben has switched to a digraph cipher in his latest message won't
say which one here but there is some nice maths involved
