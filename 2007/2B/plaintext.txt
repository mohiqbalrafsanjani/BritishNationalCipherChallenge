trinity,

i am glad you are safe. don't worry about the card, the text
will have faded back into it by now. your news about hooke is
no surprise, it is why i made contact. this is what you need to
know: i have found a way to crack quantum cryptography and hooke,
who is a fairly senior editor at my publisher's, wants to cash
in on it. i should have realised that i would upset a lot of people
(there is a lot of money, not to mention national security, invested
in quantum stuff) but in my initial excitement i mentioned it to him
as an idea for a book. it turns out that he had other plans. i guess
the info was valuable and it put a price on my head. a friend at the
nsa in the us tipped me off that there were reports of an unhealthy
interest in me and told me to disappear. when i heard about the lorry
accident near campus i called on a few favours to make it look like
i was the victim. sorry i didn't contact you before, but i didn't
want to get you involved unless i had to. when i heard that hooke had
been in touch i realised you had to disappear too. txt me on this
number next thursday at half past three and i will get back to you.
