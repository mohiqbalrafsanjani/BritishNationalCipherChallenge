vanguard off the mouth of the nile
third august seventeen ninety-eight

my lord

almighty god has blessed his majesty's arms in the late battle by
a great victory over the fleet of the enemy whom i attacked at
sunset on the first of august off the mouth of the nile
it may be true as remarked by walsingham in his last that makynge
war by means of money is of utmost import but by gad sir making
war by fire and wind quickens the spirit and nothing could
withstand the squadron your lordship did me the honour to place under
my command their high state of discipline is well known to you and
with the judgment of the captains together with their valour and that
of the officers and men of every description it was absolutely
irresistible could anything from my pen add to the character of the
captains i would write it with pleasure but that is impossible

the enemy were moored in a strong line of battle for defending the
entrance of the bay flanked by numerous gunboats four frigates and a
battery of guns and mortars on an island in their van under our guns
the ships of the enemy all but their two rear ships were nearly
dismasted and men of both sides watched in awe as l'orient blew her
powder room taking with it all the hopes of that devil napoleon
though men fled the ship many were lost to the water or the fire and
all trace of the conspiracy was consigned to the deep presses coins
and the agents of the orient all lost in that most aptly named vessel

martin was most impressed by the cunning methods employed by walsingham
in this his last letter enciphered by means of the autoclave the initial
key for the message shows much classical prescience given the fate of
marlowe it seems that their story ends badly as it appears do the lives
of the chinese agents on l'orient let us pray that ours ends well sir
