vanguard
july twenty-first seventeen ninety-eight

my lord

the messenger has returned from cape passaro and says that your
letters for me are returned to naples what a situation am i placed
in as yet i can learn nothing of the enemy and the vanguard
dismasted in a storm last may sails with a jury-rigged foremast
i may have to shift my flag into some other ship

i want to send a great number of papers to you but alas a quarrel
among the midshipmen has left me with a new and inexperienced cipher
clerk so that i dare not

martin has completed his transcription of marlowe's papers the latest
encrypted by a cunning variation on the trithemius cipher christened
the cursus clavis cipher by our classically minded friend this example
takes its key from denmark's first folio

the chinese agents carry information concerning techniques of forgery
designed to wreck our treasury as surely as a mountain of sea ice
might destroy a ship of the line martin believes that they plan to
forge and distribute large quantities of his majesty's coin in india
and thereby undermine the value of our gold there he is sure that they
will approach by the invasion and conquest of egypt and i will now
sail for alexandria in hope of intercepting them i believe that
l'orient is carrying the agents and their engines and am certain that
they must be destroyed though martin would prefer their capture

vice admiral brueys d'aigalliers will be equally sure that they must
be protected and he will not let them fall into our hands i believe he
will stand and fight on ground of his own choosing and am anxious to
oblige him in this at the earliest opportunity

i have taken the liberty to trouble your excellency with a letter for
lady nelson pray forward it for me and believe me

with the greatest respect
your most obedient servant
sir horatio nelson kb rear admiral of the blue etc
