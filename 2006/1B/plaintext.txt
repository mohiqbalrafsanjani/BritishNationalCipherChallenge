my dearest T,

thou knowest how i have served her majesty in total faith with utmost
discretion. yet now have i cause to relate to thee intelligence of the
greatest import, that is now causing much trouble in certain foreign
circles. i entreat you to act soon, for much is at risk.

through discourses with select gentlemen i know well, we heard tell of
a weapon that might perchance give great harm to our enemies. intelligence
from friends tells me that spain knoweth of this threat and even now
hath despatched a mephistophilean hoard of agents yet to seek it out.

one traitor hath offered more intelligence, but with no money at all
and little more wit, the weight of this knowledge may be plucked from
our fingers by some cruel slaughter.

i am most willing to make good a meet with this gentleman in holland
on behalf of her majesty. i seek only her sanction through you.
tarry not in your deliberations, but speed on your swift reply.

your most affectionate friend,

kit
