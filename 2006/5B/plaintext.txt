Dear t

herein i speak to thee uia alberti
Scadbury's fairest air suiteth our purpose well
our mutual guest is much pleased by thy library and our conuersations
Each morn we haue talk of philosophie and science
In return in the aftnoon he reuealeth more of the secret and we
carrie out practical inuestigations to perfect it
I document allmost fullie in the eue
T the intellectual stimulation of the inuestigations we perform raiseth my spirit
I feel so aliue and inspired i endeauour on seural new plays and poems
If duties keepeth thee at placentia i shall send some by frivier
I may choose one for to commune securlie the detailed findings
