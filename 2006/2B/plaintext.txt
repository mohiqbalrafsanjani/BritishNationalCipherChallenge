Dearest Kit,

I caution thee most severely against careless secret
writing. My cousin's already crack'd codes are
not to be dallyed with when writing on matters
of such great import this must be the last and hence-
forth thee must make use of alternate cyphers.

My Lord Burghley hath been informed. Kit, I have
compleat trust in thy word, yet he needeth more confi-
dence of it for discourse at Council. He commandeth
me to support your activities in the Lowe Coun-
tries, but with sevural strict conditions.

First, thee must cease all contacte with such dark
heretical companie. Thee exposeth thyselfe to
intrigue from divers puppets of ye popiniay
faction at Court who seeketh renewed favor thru harm
of our service.

Second, if ye become subiect to harm my Lord cannot
certaynly protect thee as one of our owne. We
dare not provoke the Spanish tyger. His power is
not spent and truely, we escaped most recent
events but by a coniunction of good piracy, fair
fire and tempest.

Third, the bearer of this missive, Master Poolye,
must share your travels. He bringeth silver from
my own purse and knowes the country well. Have a
care Kit, for as thee knoweth, he be a cosener.

Pray God Kit that thou will return soon to my furnish'd
with success,

TW
