full knowledge of the weapon are contayned in the notes here attachd
in two parts

firste the diuers methods of forgery making of false coinage and of
counterfitt note. he hath perfected a newe alchemie here showne for
making coines that bear most remark'd resemblance to dollars and ducats
that may foole euen the moste saged eye. hereto are recipes for peculiar
inks that can us'd to duplicitouslie copye the promissory notes of many
foreiyn exchainges here listed.

secondle, how such methods and other affaires may be used
in war-like actions to defeat the enemy by bringing lowe the worthe of
his monies, spreading discorde at eury leuel in societe, from the
craftsmen to the king, and moste surely laying lowe the countrie itself.
the agent hath yet detayled the persones, groups, and counting houses
in diuers countries both by whom such discordance might most fullie
and quicklie be spreade, and hath prouided letters of introduction
to the same.

T, i am now bound to report to the council on false charge by wicked
wit-gifts and fear the worst may come. what happeneth now? can Cecil
saue me?

make haste with thy reply.
