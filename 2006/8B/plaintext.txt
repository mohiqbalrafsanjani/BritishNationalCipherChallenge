Dear Kit,

The informations and deuices for makynge war by means of money is of utmost import.
Essex be now moste suspicious and hath cause to take thy endeauors for his owne profite. He maketh allies with
Whitgift and yet others at Council to submyt thee to trial on charges of blasphemie whereby they might obtain from thee
by fair or foul.

My Lord Burghley is moste pleased and to guard the intelligence hath deuelpd a plat to cheat the charges against thee.
He hath commanded me to require thee on Wednesday nexte to attend at Council, thence to Deptforde, there to waite in
our house of widowe Bull on the Strande, next the water, till night. Master Poley will there conueye to thee further
instruction. Againste pursuit and as Deptforde be yet dangerous at night, thee should go thence in the companie of Frizier
for protection.

Kit it maye perforce be for us to part, but yet I hope it not be for longe. The Danish piece you sent last is masterful.
