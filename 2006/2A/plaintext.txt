my lord

joining minerve i sailed for cartagena in search of the spanish fleet
missing them there i sailed for cape st vincent and on the night of
february eleventh under thick fog found myself amid the very ships for
which i was searching we passed undetected by the sleeping lookouts and
joined your squadron with utmost expedition it was with great honour
that we joined my lord in furious battle with the spanish fleet and
i must record my most excellent thanks for the support of captain
collingwood whose decisive action relieved my ship at her most dangerous
point

martin made much of intelligence he gathered from sailors aboard the
san josef they imparted a story of a chinese agent conveyed thereon to
tenneriffe and quartered now in santa cruz martin is most anxious to
interview this agent and i await my lords instructions in this and other
matters
