vanguard july twentieth seventeen ninety-eight

my dear sir

it is an old saying the devil's children have the devil's luck
i cannot find or to this moment learn beyond vague conjecture
where the french fleet and its precious oriental cargo are gone
to from every information off malta i believed they were gone to
egypt therefore on theth i was communicating with alexandria in
egypt where i found the turks preparing to resist them but know
nothing beyond report from thence i stretched over to the coast
of caramania not meeting a single vessel that could give me
information i am as ignorant of the situation of the enemy as i
was twenty-seven days ago

i sincerely hope that the dispatches which i understand are at
cape passaro will give me full information i shall be able for
nine or ten weeks longer to keep the fleet on active service when
we shall want provisions and stores in about six days

i shall sail from hence and if i hear nothing more from the french
i shall go to the archipelago where if they are gone towards
constantinople i shall hear of them i shall go to cyprus and if
they are gone to alexandretta or any other part of syria or egypt
i shall get information

martin has at last broken the ciphers of marlowe and walsingham
among them the wretched alberti and trimethius ciphers and believes
that that marlowe's interest in coining might lie at the heart of
the mystery

rumours of a french line of battleship off cape passaro carrying all
the riches of the east lend weight to martin's proposition that
napoleon's flagship l'orient may be the key to the entire mystery
and its destruction should be our highest goal
