by sir horatio nelson order of the bath rear admiral of the blue

my lord

the attack upon santa cruz was of marginal success shore parties
led by thompson fremantle and bowen landed and six twenty-four
pounders were spiked however many men were lost and my own arm
was sacrificed to the guns my life was saved by my stepson
lieutenant nisbet who staunched the wound and i was returned to
the seahorse for surgery

despite the failure to cut out the spanish treasure ship contact
was made with the chinese agent and martin is of the opinion that
this alone justifies the losses the two of them will return with
me to england aboard the seahorse while martin continues his
enquiries

at present the agent speaks only of a mysterious system by which
an entire country might be ruined

martin continues his work on the marlowe diaries and he tells me
that the most recent letter is most cunningly enciphered i have
included herein a subtle allusion to its origin

given on board the seahorse
to lord st vincent admiral of the blue and commander-in-chief
of his majesty's ships and vessels employed and to be employed
in the mediterranean etc etc etc
