comrades

the weather held for the drop and the assault group made its rendezvous
with the weather station they are now waiting for instructions about
the rendezvous with the gru division the weather station predicts two
days of clear weather for the evacuation starting in forty-two hours

you are to track the surface party from under the ice and to keep
marines at the ready to support them if necessary engage and sink the
mikhael five but do not endanger your own ship it is the only suitable
support vessel available for the operation

the weather station is equipped with a pair of new cipher machines known
as the fialka these are being tested for reliability in sea operations
but early tests are promising and you are ordered to take delivery of
one of their machines and use it in future communications the final
production model has ten rotors and is highly secure the weather station
model is less complicated but will afford a reasonable level of security
for your more important communications our next message to you will
contain information about settings for the machine which will allow you
to send your final report on the operation using it i need hardly remind
you that these machines must not fall into american hands
