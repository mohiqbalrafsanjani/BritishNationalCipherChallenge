comrades, it is our historic duty to recover an article of great value
to the motherland, product of the greatest scientific minds in the
soviet union, and the labour of the world's greatest engineers. this
object, about which i can say no more at present, is hiding in deep
waters under the arctic ice, and it is our privilige to retrieve it. we
have trained hard for just such a role, and now we have an opportunity
to show our navy just what this boat can do. comrades malinovski and
shelepin have personally recommended our crew to comrade khrushchev for
this mission. succeed and perhaps we will be allowed the honour of being
the first soviet boat to reach the north pole under the ice. fail and we
will return in shame to our families. the honour of the soviet union
lies in our hands.
