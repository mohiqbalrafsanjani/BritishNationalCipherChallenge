The Soviet message contained valuable information and a
tantalising clue concerning the object we are required to
recover. The K3 is believed to be the first serving nuclear
powered boat in the Soviet fleet and its captain is an
experienced officer. The choice of this boat may indicate
that the Soviets intend to stay submersed for some time,
and this confirms my suspicion that they do not have
good intelligence concerning the location of the object.
Given its apparent designation as a beacon I am puzzled
that there is no signal for us to follow. I would
recommend monitoring the spectrum for unexpected
activity near the crash site. Our radio room sent me the
enclosed signal which is believed to have been
transmitted by the K3 prior to diving. As you predicted it
is encrypted, but it appears, only lightly, and I will
endeavour to decipher it quickly. Meanwhile I would
recommend that we improve security by hiding the word
structure of our messages using the standard 5 letter
block format.
