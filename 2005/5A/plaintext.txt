I have had time to think about the extraordinary
accuracy of the timing signal from the spacecraft and
have noticed two features which set me thinking. First
the signal is absolute not relative, that is there is some
kind of counter yielding a time rather than just a regular
beat. This signal is similar to but different from the signal
from the recently launched satellite in space but differs
from it very slightly. In trying to account for the
difference I realise I was using Newtonian mechanics but
maybe we need to use relativity to explain it. The clock in
the orbiting satellite seems to be running slowly but
maybe that is a result of time dilation. I keep thinking
that the timer is the key to understanding the purpose of
these satellites.

Anyway, I broke the last message and have the beginning
of a plan: the Soviets don't seem to be tracking us too
well under water. I propose that we surface out of sight
of the weather ship and land our own party of marines to
intercept the beacon we can then submerge and make out that
we are trying to engage the Leninsky Komosomov as a diversion.

Our Morse transcription machine works well but I adjusted
it a little to cope with the full morse alphabet I seem to
have switched one of the circuits by mistake and the zero
now stands for the dot instead of the dash but it is pretty
easy to work with it this way and I think I will leave it.
