comrades

the pritok has located the beacon and our weather station is coordinating
the recovery there is a serious risk that the american submarine may try
to intercept the leninsky komosomov once you have retrieved the beacon
and we have therefore decided to modify our recovery plan once the beacon
is retrieved you are to rendezvous with the weather station which is
currently ice bound we will fly a special services patrol to the
rendezvous and they will travel across the ice pack to a point within
range of the misix helicopter it has a range of three hundred miles so
should be able to reach a point several miles from the edge of the ice
pack it will be difficult for the americans to track the surface party
but in any case they are likely to follow the submarine and you are to
act as a decoy travel fast but keep them in contact the mig fighters will
be available for air cover if you run into difficulties but they are
unreliable in bad weather and have only short-range radar
