Encryption is a form of cryptography, a secret writing
which involves making information unreadable by obscuring
it. For centuries it has been used by governments, organisations,
or important individuals with a huge need for secrecy, but
is now used in new widely used systems such as the internet
and mobile networks. It works in either a code, the cumbersome
way of replacing whole words or phrases with something else,
or the much more useful cipher, which instead focuses on changing
small pieces of the text such as individual letters. Old pen and
paper ciphers include the Caesar shift which involves shifting
letters a fixed amount round the alphabet. These ciphers
come in two main types: substitution, changing letters for
new letters or symbols, and transposition, mixing the letters
up. During the twentieth century complex rotor machines like
the Enigma were used to encrypt messages. Computers bring
modern ways of encrypting digital messages. These new ciphers
are either public-key, where anyone can send a message to someone,
or private-key, in which the key must be kept secret.
