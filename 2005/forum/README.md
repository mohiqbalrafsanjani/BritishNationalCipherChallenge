In the forum, a participant calling himself Captain Cool posted a
challenge that uses the Solitaire cipher. A copy of his post is in
`post.txt`

The known cards in the deck are

    10H, QD, 4H, JH, KH, AS, 4D, 9H, 10C, JC, KS, KC, 5S, 10D, 3S, QC, 2D, 3D,
    AC, JS, 9S, KD, 9C, 2H, 4S, AH, QS, 8H, 2S, 5D, JokerB, 7C, QH, 7D, 4C, 6S,
    6D, 9D, 7S, 8S, JD, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?

    36, 25, 30, 37, 39, 40, 17, 35, 10, 11, 52, 13, 44, 23, 42, 12, 15,
    16, 1, 50, 48, 26, 9, 28, 43, 27, 51, 34, 41, 18, 54, 7, 38,
    20, 4, 45, 19, 22, 46, 47, 24, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

We have the solution, but do not know the phrase that was used to key
the deck.
