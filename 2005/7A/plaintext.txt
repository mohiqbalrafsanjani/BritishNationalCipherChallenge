My time aboard the weather station was interesting to
say the least! We obtained photos of the new cipher
machine and, believe it or not, a full set of wiring
diagrams together with the settings for the next month!
As far as I know our presence was not detected. There
was no sign of life and I guess our diversion worked. The
low visibility on the ice helped. The machine I studied
was remarkably unsophisticated and bore little
resemblance to the ten-wheel rotor machine our contacts
had led us to expect. It may be that as a weather station
model it has been kept simple. They may also have been
worried that it would fall into enemy hands and therefore
have issued only this prototype. Nonetheless they seem
convinced of its security. Time will tell. I will give a
fuller report on the structure of the machine, its operation,
and its current settings in my next message.

By the way, I found the enclosed plaintext next to the
machine, and it looked as though it was about to be sent.
It may be worth listening out for the next weather station
transmission.

In the meantime I will attack the latest Soviet message.
They seem to have scaled up the security again, though I
don't think this one uses the rotor machine so it shouldn't
be too steep.
