The boat's radio room has detected signals from the area
of the last sighting. These signals are highly regular in
keeping with the designation of beacon and I assume
they are intended as a form of locator device in a
recovery situation. The average depth of the arctic basin
is well beyond the operating depth of this boat, however
triangulating the signal over the last forty eight hours we
believe that the beacon is in shallower water lying over
the Lomonosov ridge. It is likely that the Leninsky
Komsomo, a November class boat, can operate at greater
depths than us, but we have the edge on speed and
probably on detectors so we may be able to recover the
beacon before they arrive. At this time of year sea ice
cover means that our direct route to the ridge will take
us under the ice through shallow water. The journey will
stress the crew so we need to minimise the distance
travelled. We will continue to monitor the signal. Any
information you can give us about location will be greatly
appreciated.
