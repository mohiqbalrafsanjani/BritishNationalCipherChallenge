I have been puzzled by certain features of the beacon
signal: given the unlikelihood that the beacon would, at
these latitudes, land in sufficiently shallow water for
recovery I am surprised that the Soviet engineers would
supply a location device. If the beacon was destined for
orbit the additional weight of a locator circuit would be
difficult to justify. Assuming that the soviets do not want
us to salvage the beacon I wonder why they would place
a signalling device on board which would certainly betray
its presence to enemy ships. I figure that rather than
playing an auxilliary role, the beacon signal is a main
function of the device. Speaking with the Officer of the
Watch I learnt that we are passing close to the wreckage
of the launch vehicle. I suggest we make a detour for
inspection and analysis. One last remark. Given the
surface scattering the signal from the device is hard to
detect but the traces we have found show that its timing
is extraordinarily precise and regular. I have no
explanation for this but it is difficult to believe it is
a case of over-engineering.
