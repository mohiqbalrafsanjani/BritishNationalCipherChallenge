attachment: report from the captain of the leninsky komsomov

comrades,

i have great pleasure in reporting the total success of our mission
our surface troops made the rendezvous with the spetznaz and caught
the american marines just as they tried to arrange the theft of
the beacon although heavily out-numbered our heroic troops killed
35 of the enemy and shot down the very plane the capitalists were
using in their monstrous attack on our technological achievements
a full report will follow

our casualties were heavy but our comrades made their sacrifice
knowing that they were protecting the glorious motherland before
they died they reported that their assault on the capitalist
invaders resulted in the total destruction of the beacon and this
was later confirmed by our reconnaissance party who discovered the
wreckage in the burning plane have no fear comrades the efficiency
of our advanced technology factories means that we have already
replaced the loss the crew of the leninsky komsomov has performed
in a totally dedicated professional and resourceful way out-witting
the enemy at every step another triumph for the soviet naval training
regime our glorious submarine has shown it is able to out manoeuvre
and evade the best that the enemy can throw at us we truly now have
dominion under the waves we are returning to base at once and eagerly
await our next opportunity to serve the motherland
