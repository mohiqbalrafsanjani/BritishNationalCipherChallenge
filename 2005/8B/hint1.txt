FIRST HINT FOR CHALLENGE 8B

[For clarification: this is NOT a change to the text of Challenge 8B, it
is extra information about it. You still need to submit your decryption
of the ORIGINAL 8B text.]


I just got this from signals intelligence. Apparently immediately after
we received the encrypted transmission yesterday from the Weather
Station we picked up a ghost transmission from the same source on a
different frequency. It was very faint but we were close enough to get
all of it I think. Here it is:

As you can see it starts off the same as the transmission we received
but has a whole chunk extra at the end. I asked the radio guys if they
have any idea what was happening and one of them suggested that it might
be a secure long range transmission using a directional mast. That's why
we found it hard to pick up. But he made an interesting remark. If it
was long range then the main part of the message (after any headers,
weather reports etc) would normally be sent twice in case of
transmission errors. If my hunch is right this extra text will be the
report from the captain of the Leninsky Komsomov. Now looking at the text we can see they haven't just transmitted the encrypted text twice, so I figure they have a made a classic mistake and instead have encrypte part of the message twice!. If my hunch is right the extra text is just the captain's report and I think we all might be able
to guess how that starts.

Now it is almost certainly a coincidence that the initial message had
1296 characters in it but it is highly significant for us. It means that
at the end of encrypting the original whole message the rotors were back at their
initial position. If the clerk then re-entered the captain's report he
would have been doing so from the SAME INITIAL SETTINGS as the machine
started with.

If we can guess how the captain's report starts then we might be able to
reduce the number of possible wirings of the rotors.

I had a look at my notes, and have a couple more observations to make on
the machine. The rotors are driven using a similar mechanism to the
Enigma. The first rotor turns fast and every complete revolution of it
drives the second rotor one notch in the opposite direction. The catch
engaging the second rotor is adjacent to the Z on the wheel, but of
course if the first rotor is inserted with the Z at the top then the
second rotor could turn when the first character is entered. By putting the
first rotor in at different positions you can get the first turn of the
second rotor at any of the first 36 characters of the ciphertext.
Presumably the Soviet cipherclerk had been given initial settings for
the rotors. Maybe they were written down and I didn't notice.

Our photolab guys tell me that the other rotor image should be back from
processing at 3.30pm on Monday.

More later.
