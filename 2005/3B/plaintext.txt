comrades

the lomonosov weather station reports tracking sonar signals which
indicate the presence of a boat under the ice over the ridge while
the narrow channel under the ice carried the sound well tracking the
signal has proved difficult but we believe it to be the mikhael five
on course to recover the beacon contact the weather station directly
for weather updates your path to the north of the ridge is longer
but travelling in deeper water you can make way faster than the us
boat and with less strain upon your crew

meanwhile we received the following intelligence from fleet cosmic
intelligence directorate the second missile of the longitude project
was launched successfully last night and the second beacon is now in
orbit if the americans retrieve the satellite before you do then they
may launch their own longitude project and we will have lost the
strategic lead we should otherwise gain space intelligence directorate
at vatutinki requests that you forward all traces of the beacon signal
for engineering analysis it will be good to determine the effect of
the impact on the timing signal
