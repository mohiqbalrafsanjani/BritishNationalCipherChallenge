CHALLENGE 7B FIRST HINT

.... if this can be called a first hint given the amount of information leaking out in the comments.


If you haven't figured this out yet, Challenge 7B is encrypted with a Hill cipher. You should have enough of a crib to almost get this without too much work, but of course we haven't made it too easy.

The clue in part 7A was the reference to "steep'. Not much of a clue but it was there and professionals work with less!

Knowing this you could this worse than read the comments from the over the weekend looking for info about how to tackle this cipher. There seems to be a concensus that you are better off trying to solve the simultaneous equations using the obvious crib, together with a bit of brute force and common sense. Good luck.
