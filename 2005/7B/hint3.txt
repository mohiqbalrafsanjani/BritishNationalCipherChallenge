Extended crib

For those of you working on Challenge 7B here is an extended crib I have worked out

The first eighteen characters of the cipher text are

SSODTUQOEBIEFKYJXM

The first eighteen characters of the plaintext are

COMRADESWEAREUNDER

You might even take a guess at the next six characters if you are feeling lucky, Anyway it gives you something more to check your calculations against.

Good luck,
