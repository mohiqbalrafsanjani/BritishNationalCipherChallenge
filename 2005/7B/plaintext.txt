comrades

we are under attack the spetznaz surface party made good time carrying
the beacon towards the shore however they were caught in a pincer
movement by two large parties of american marines out-numbered by ten
to one they have been forced to abandon the mission

we are tracking the beacon and hope to surface nearby in order to
retrieve it the american submarine was following us but using our
superior navigational skills we have out-manoeuvred it and left it
behind we took on troops from the weather station and they will
rendezvous with the spetznaz to destroy the us commandos we shall
then meet our victorious troops at the edge of the ice pack

the superiority of our scientists in technological engineering have
again been proved throughout the recovery mission the beacon continues
to transmit its time signal without interruption and the inclusion of
the relativistic correction means that it continues to be perfectly
synchronised with the orbiting device our navigator has been able to
use the signal to triangulate successfully our position it is clear
that with more beacons we have the basis for determining our location
anywhere on the earth another victory for the motherland

once we have met our victorious comrades with the beacon we will transmit
our final report using the new rotary cipher
