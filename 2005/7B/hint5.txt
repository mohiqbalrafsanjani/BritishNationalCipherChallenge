last chance for 7B

Here are the first two row fo the decryption matrix for Challenge 7B

2 21 17
10 4 9

You should be able to do the rest by looking at what this gives you.

[By the way, if you are doing the decryption as vM, where M is the matrix and v is a row vector then these are the first two columns instead.]
