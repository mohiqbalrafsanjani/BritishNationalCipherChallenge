Harry,

The divers have returned from examining the wreck of the
rocket. There isn't much left and not a lot to tell.
From what you told them and what they saw it looks
like the second stage of the rocket failed to separate
from the first so there wasn't enough lift to make orbit.
When the fuel ran out the whole thing crashed and
burned. I guess the beacon was thrown clear. The fact
that the rocket was staged must mean it was intended
for orbit so your guess that the beacon is a satellite
seems good.

While at the surface we pulled in signals from a Soviet
weather station on the Lomonosov. Seems to be using the
same encryption systems as the Leninsky Komsomov and
I've told the guys in the radio room to keep tabs on
them when they can.

We also spotted a Soviet plane patrolling the ice -
probably a tupolev ninety-five (we call them "Bears").
Intel. say this might be the "pritok" variant, a
prototype for locating landed space-craft but we didn't
think that was flying ops yet.

By the way, our cipher guys in the NSA tell us to expect
the Soviets to switch to a more secure system. They picked
up a weather broadcast using a transposition cipher and
reckon the sub may follow suit.
