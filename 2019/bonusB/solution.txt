The first text is encrypted using binary, binary, binary, and ternary digits.
Each group of four letters in the ciphertext is decrypted to one letter of
the first plaintext. The least significant digit is A=0 or B=1. Next is
D=0 or E=2. Then G=0 or H=4. Finally, J=0 or K=8 or L=16. There are 24
possibilities, and the keyword is ALICE, and the keyed alphabet is

    ALICEBDFGHKMNOPQRSTUVWXY

The second cipher works by numbering the permutations of four objects:
0 = WXYZ, 1=WXZY, ..., 24=ZYXW. The four objects in this case are the four
digits from the first cipher. Again, each group of four letters in the
ciphertext is decrypted to one letter of the second plaintext. For this
part, the keyword is LOOKINGGLASS, and the keyed alphabet is

    LOKINGASBCDEFHMPQRTUVWXY

In three places (one in the first text, two in the second), "just" is
rendered as "iust", since the cipher does not use the letter J.
