From your tormentor, Madness:

While I have been away, I have been thinking about the 9B cipher,
and I realized that there is room in there for more information.
With four digits per letter, there must be a way to cram more
into it. So I modified it into a new cipher. The following
ciphertext contains TWO plaintexts, each encrypted with a
different scheme. Both use a 24-letter alphabet, like 9B.
I hope you enjoy trying to crack them.

Harry's sadism is well documented on the forum, but mine is just
starting to show. MwahahaHAHA! Trying to decrypt both texts will
drive you MAD. Mad! I say.

I will tell you this much:
There is no diffusion step in the cipher(s) like the period-7 diffusion of 9B.
There are not two ciphertexts interleaved, or any such scheme;
you need the entire ciphertext to recover each plaintext.
The texts have nothing to do with the story of this year's challenge,
so there are no cribs to help you.

Submit your solution in the usual way, we will switch on feedback from the start.
