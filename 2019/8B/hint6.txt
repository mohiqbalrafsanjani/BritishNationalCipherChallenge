The characters are laid out in a grid:

 |A B C D E
-|----------
F|
G|    x
H|
I|
K|

If x appears in the row labelled G and the column labelled C then the cipher replacement for x is GC. Once you realise this is what is happening you just have to do a frequency analysis counting how often each pair FA, FB, FC, FD, FE, GA, GB, etc appears and crack it just like you would any normal substitution cipher. Good luck!
