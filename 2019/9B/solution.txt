The alphabet is
CHLORISTUVWXYABDEFGKMNPQ
with the keyword CHLORIS.

Chloris was a flower nymph in Greek mythology, or a daughter of Niobe.

To decrypt, break the ciphertext into blocks of 28 digits, then
into sub-blocks of 7 digits. For example, here is the first block:

    1110100 1010000 1211221 0001101

The first letter of the plaintext is encoded by the first digit of
each sub-block:

    1110100 1010000 1211221 0001101
    ^       ^       ^       ^       -> 1110

The second letter is encoded by the second digit of each sub-block:

    1110100 1010000 1211221 0001101
     ^       ^       ^       ^      -> 1020

Likewise, 5 more letters are encoded in this block, and 7 letters
are encoded in every 28-digit block.

The number system that is being used is a combination of binary
and ternary. The first, second, and fourth digits are in binary,
while the third digit is ternary (base 3). To convert to decimal,

    12 x first digit + 6 x second digit + 2 x third digit + fourth digit

Note that there are only 24 numbers that you can make in this way,
and that the alphabet that was used contains only 24 letters (no J, Z).

Here is a table of the conversion from four-digit codes to letters:

    0000 =  0  C        0110 =  8  U        1020 = 16  E
    0001 =  1  H        0111 =  9  V        1021 = 17  F
    0010 =  2  L        0120 = 10  W        1100 = 18  G
    0011 =  3  O        0121 = 11  X        1101 = 19  K
    0020 =  4  R        1000 = 12  Y        1110 = 20  M
    0021 =  5  I        1001 = 13  A        1111 = 21  N
    0100 =  6  S        1010 = 14  B        1120 = 22  P
    0101 =  7  T        1011 = 15  D        1121 = 23  Q

The cipher is a modification of the bifid and trifid ciphers, to use
a four-dimensional box to hold the keyed alphabet. Because the box
does not have the same lengths in all of the dimensions, the fractionation
and diffusion steps can be done, but the recombination back into letters
cannot. The period is clearly 7. The size of the box is 2x2x3x2, so
that the coordinates are binary, binary, ternary, and binary digits.
