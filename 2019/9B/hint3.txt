I will help you a tiny little bit!
If Harry allows (it gives nothing away)

[I will allow it, but not yet. Have set to reveal after 23:00 on Saturday night, Harry]

In 9B the digits 0,1,2 make up the cipher.
The Digits Frequencies are
0(9605) 1(7427) 2(1448)
and they are in 4620 blocks of five digits each.

There now you know as much as me!
Do start doing something, nothing ever got solved by just looking at it!

And no, I have not solved it yet.
