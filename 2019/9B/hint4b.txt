*Hoping Harry will let me post this*
9B seems to have been written in ternary, as it gives out almost english frequencies, but this gives 27 characters, would the most common be a space, if do what sort of frequency should I be looking for??

Maybe 27 is too many. You could probably do without any Zs as well. How many letters do you *really* need?
