WHY DO WE KEEP SPENDING OUR TIME TRYING TO CRACK CIPHERS?
WHY? BECAUSE WE JUST GOTTA KNOW WHAT THE PLAINTEXT IS, THAT'S WHY!
FOR DAYS, WEEKS, MONTHS OR EVEN YEARS WE TOIL AWAY WITH OUR
MATHEMATICAL ALGORITHYMS, IOC ANALYTICS AND CIPHER PROGRAMS BUT...
OOH, THAT THRILL WHEN THE PLAINTEXT FINALLY APPEARS, AND WE PUNCH THE AIR, OR
DO A FOREHEAD-PALM WHILE MUTTERING 'I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT!', YEH,
THAT'S WHAT KEEPS US COMING BACK FOR MORE! WE'LL NOT REST UNTIL ALL THE
UNSOLVED CIPHERS REVEAL THEIR CONTENT - MAYBE EVEN CRACK A LONG STANDING
UNSOLVED ONE AND GAIN SOME RECOGNITION - WELL, WE CAN ALL DREAM!

NOW THAT YOU HAVE SOLVED THE CIPHER I NEED YOU TO DO A LITTLE MATH.
SOME PROGRAMMING WILL BE NEEDED.
I HAVE A BOOK CONTAINING A LOT OF CIPHERS. THE CIPHERS WERE FOLLOWED BY THE
KEYS FOR SOLVING THEM, AND THEN BY THE PLAINTEXT OF EACH CIPHER. I SAY WERE
BECAUSE I REMOVED THOSE PAGES AND PUT THEM IN A SEALED ENVELOPE NOT TO BE
OPENED UNTIL I WAS ABLE TO SOLVE ALL THE CIPHERS.
NOW THE MATHMATICIAN IN ME THOUGHT OF A LITTLE PROBLEM FOR YOU.
WHEN I ADDED UP ALL THE PAGE NUMBERS THAT I HAD REMOVED FROM THE BOOK THE TOTAL
CAME TO TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED AND SIXTY SEVEN.
THE PROBLEM I PUT BEFORE YOU IS TO TELL ME THE NUMBERS OF THE REMOVED PAGES.
POST YOUR ANSWER INTO ELEVEN B USING ONLY THE WORDS 'PAGE N TO PAGE N'
IN THE FORM: - PAGE ONE TO PAGE TWENTY ONE - SUBSTITUTING THE EXAMPLE NUMBERS
FOR THE CORRECT ONES.
