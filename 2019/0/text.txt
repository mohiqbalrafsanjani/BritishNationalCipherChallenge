Harry Returns

On 1st October 1958 the National Aeronautics and Space Administration opened its doors for the first time. The men and women who worked there were some of the brightest of their generation, and they solved problems that no one even knew how to formulate just five years before. They were responsible for the lives and safety of the Mercury, Gemini and Apollo Astronauts who took us to the Moon and united the world in a new understanding of the fragility and beauty of our planet. Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, John Young and Jim Lovell became household names across the globe as millions watched their adventures, but for each famous astronaut there were tens of thousands of hidden figures whose work made those journeys possible, and for each success there were hundreds of failures that could have jeopardised missions or costs lives.
Now, for the first time, we can tell the secret story of a sequence of accidents that might have destroyed NASA and could have led to nuclear war, if it wasn't for the efforts of Harry and his team as they raced to stop the countdown to catastrophe.
