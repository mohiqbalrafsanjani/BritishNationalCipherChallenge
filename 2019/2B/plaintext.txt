Apollo Ten
Spacecraft Operational Trajectory
First Revision
This document contains updated information about the planned lunar orbital operations for the mission and has been compiled to satisfy flight crew/flight controller training and simulation requirements.

The following mission phases remain UNCHANGED from the original plan:
Launch, which ends with insertion into earth parking orbit (EPO).
Earth orbit coast, which ends with Translunar Injection (TLI).
Trans Lunar coast, which ends with Lunar Orbit Insertion (LOI).
Trans Earth coast, which ends with re-entry into the mid-Pacific recovery area.

The total mission duration will be approximately EIGHT days.

The report includes significant changes to Lunar orbital operations, which start at LOI and end with Trans Earth lnjection. NOTE THESE IMPORTANT TRAJECTORY CHANGES

The prime objective of the LOI-TEI phase will be to demonstrate all
components of Mission G except those which directly involve Lunar Module powered descent and powered ascent.
