tovarishchi,

our agents in the us have concluded their investigations and have
determined that there is indeed a saboteur working in the heart of
the capitalist space agency security there has tightened but they
have been unable to discover who it is that is working to undermine
their efforts to colonise space

no one in the kgb or gru is aware of anybody working directly for us
who would or could have carried out these attacks furthermore the risk
of an escalation leading to all-out war means that brezhnev would never
countenance or authorize such a mission even if we had the assets in
place to carry it out the memory of the confrontation over the missile
base in kuba still burns and the possibility of nuclear annihilation
is too strong to justify this sort of action indeed the politburo has
determined that the race to space is better fought in near-earth orbit
where our own technology has already proved itself to be superior the
first satellite and the first manned spaceflights were accomplished
by our heroes at baikonur our american comrades may have thought us
weak when we moved our lunar orbiter to ensure the safety of their
first lunar landing but this was an entirely strategic move intended
to build confidence between our two nations

what will they do now that that the first lunar landing has been
accomplished more landings how many moonrocks can they possibly need
and what will it cost for them to bring them home every mission they
launch risks catastrophic failure and now it seems that one of their
own is working to ensure the total humiliation of the capitalist
system

meanwhile our goals are better met by striving to learn from the
americans cooperating where we must to ensure that we win where we
can nasa administrators have already made overtures to us concerning
joint exploration and our plan is to build on the dryden-blagonravov
agreement if we can coordinate a joint mission this should give us
access to some of the american technical and training materials
while our own rocket systems are far more sophisticated than theirs
their reliance on the skill of their astronauts means that they have
learned far more about the limits of human endurance and performance
than we have been able to so far

it will take some time to overcome the american distrust of our state
and its agencies but as long as they do not believe that we are behind
the recent sabotage attempts then i think we will be able to achieve
this goal
