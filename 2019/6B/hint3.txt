Yes I can, but I don't think it will help. You can (more or less) find the keyword at the start of 6B!

Now everyone who has cracked it is chuckling to themselves and/or facepalming, but as I said, this is not really all that helpful I don't think.

Have you worked out the anagram stage? Once you are confident with that the rest is just a standard substitution cipher, so should be doable even with the blocking.

Good luck,

Harry
