(Harry, I am writing this hint now, but I am counting on you to publish it in a few days, when you think it should be published)

So 9A is one of the most common ciphers used in the later part of the competition. It requires a keyword, which everyone reading this will know. Just think of the most famous line to do with NASA, change it a bit, and you are done.

Good luck
