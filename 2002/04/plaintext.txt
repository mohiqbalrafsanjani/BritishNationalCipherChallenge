Dear Prof. Babbage

I write as a matter of some urgency to convey the most awful news. It appears
that the documents you entrusted to Prof. Wheatstone have been taken. He
believes the incident may be connected with the strange French interloper you
discovered recently by your house. Prof. Wheatstone was accosted by a band of
ruffians in Hanover Square while on his way to meet his brother William at
their Conduit Street shop. The rogues handled him most roughly and wrested
from him his case containing plans for the turning machine and his latest
designs for a concertina, though fortunately he was not injured. He noticed
that their leader had a French accent and pursued the miscreants vigorously,
calling for assistance. His efforts were in vain, and not one of Peel's men
came to his aid as he followed the vagabonds. He believes that the French
ringleader has fled to Southampton and has himself taken lodgings there by the
west quay in order to make further investigations. I shall make enquiries with
my friends in the foreign office. In the meantime, it occurs to me that we
should encrypt our messages more strongly. My own work on the theory of
numbers suggests that a more mathematical rule for encryption would be a fine
and effective replacement for the keyword cipher used in this message.

Yours, L
