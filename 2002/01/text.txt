To My Dear W,

Here, the Countess and I continue to work on the science of automated
computation and there is much to tell about progress with our device. Even so
the many recent changes to our plans seem to be causing some consternation to
our sponsors and I fear that funding for our research remains uncertain.
Certainly L is a prodigious and enigmatic mathematician and we have spent many
splendid hours recently discussing the new device which we call the Turning
Machine. Outwardly ordinary in appearance, it will quickly compile secret
messages in a devilish cipher inspired by one employed by our erstwhile enemy.
Draft plans have been produced by the Countess and me, and we would value your
opinion of them. Especially given your reputation as an expert on
electro-mechanical devices. (Perhaps you can attend for dinner on Saturday.
The Countess should also be there.)

By now I need not remind you that secrecy is of the utmost importance. Of
course it is essential that all future communications concerning the device
should be encrypted. Outstanding examples of ciphers and their use may be
found in a book by the estimable Mr Singh, the title of which is concealed
within this missive.

Kind regards, Chas

PS You might also examine the slim monograph by Mr Holmes which I fear is much
more difficult to come by. I would suggest that your reply should be
enciphered using a fairly simple cipher. There is no need to provide the key;
it will provide me with a pleasant diversion to decipher it.
