CONFIDENTIAL

Dear W,

My own inexperience in such matters suggests that I should place
myself in your good hands, but I must admit a reluctance to allow
the rogue to walk free, having engaged in such callow treachery
with the old enemy. Is it not possible to use our knowledge to
spring a trap, perhaps calling on the assistance of Peel's
metropolitan force? Perhaps we could offer to discuss terms in
some public forum and wrest the plans from the miscreant with their
help. The monument would provide a convenient location for such a
rendezvous. I suggest we offer seventy guineas for the safe return
of the plans, but be prepared to go as high as one hundred guineas
if he proves intractable. I would be able to provide such a sum if
necessary. However, I do feel unequal to the task of dealing directly
with this fellow and would ask if you could make the necessary
arrangements.

Looking forward to a speedy and successful conclusion to this most
disagreeable affair.

Yours as ever, B
