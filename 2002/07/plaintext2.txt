I am pleased to say that the Vigen√®re cipher is not as secure as our French
friends seem to believe. I have spent some time studying the method and I am
sure that I have devised a way to prise open this French enigma. The key, if
you will excuse the intolerable pun, lies in identifying the period of
repetition of the cipher, which one can deduce by analysis of repetition
patterns in the enciphered text. The length of the keyword may be revealed as
a common factor of the periods of such repetitions. Of course, all my research
will avail us nothing without more information, so I must beg your assistance
again, my dear countess, in obtaining more intelligence from your extensive
circle of contacts.
