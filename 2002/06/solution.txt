Here is my translation of the plaintext:

It has been a while that we have been surveying the progress of Professor
Babbage on his difference and analysis motors. Recently our local agent
intercepted encoded correspondence between Babbage and his two accomplices,
Professor Wheatstone and Countess Lovelace. Together they are three of the
most original minds of their generation. It seems that they are involved
in the development of a machine for the automatic encoding of messages,
which would be a terrible threat to the interests of beautiful France.
We are studying the possibility of making secret copies of these plans
by utilizing the ingenious system of Mr. Daguerre. Please, please, contact
the thief who is suspected to be in Southampton. There is no doubt that
this traitor of a scoundrel will seek to impose his own price. This is of
the highest national importance, being the object of sanction by Louis
Philippe himself and could threaten the quadruple alliance if it fell into
the wrong hands. All future correspondence concerning this subject must
have a Vigen√®re code, which is the most impossible to decode.
