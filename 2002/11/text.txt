    MONUMENTAL DISASTER

    In an extraordinary incident involving the distinguished scientist and instrument maker Prof Charles Wheatstone, a Frenchman plunged some 200 feet to his death from The Monument. The purpose of the meeting between Prof Wheatstone and the deceased has yet to be explained, though a large sum of money was said to have been taken from the dead man and passed to Prof Wheatstone by the Peelers at the scene of the accident. Adding to the enigma of the events, reports suggest that members of Lord Peel's constabulary were seen in the vicinity before the dramatic events unfurled, leading to speculation that the incident had been expected.

    The dead man, later identified as M Edouard Spion, is believed to have taken lodgings at Todgers Boarding House, and in a further extraordinary development it was revealed today that his rooms included a variety of diverse mysterious scientific equipment and chemicals including iodine, bromine, and mercury. Investigators are baffled by the discovery and have appealed for assistance in tracing the provenance of the mysterious equipment.

    Suggestions that the family of Lord Byron were also associated with the affair have been described as fanciful.

    Prof Wheatstone is well known for his work on electro-mechanical communication devices, and is believed to have been collaborating with the inventor Mr Babbage on a secret project.
