CHALLENGE 12 HINT

As spelt out in the plaintext part of this challenge the cipher this week is a Playfair cipher. You can find a good account of how this cipher works in Appendix E of "The Code Book" (pages 372-373). This cipher is a digraph cipher, i.e., it replaces pairs of letters by pairs of letters, so frequency analysis of individual characters won't help. However you can use frequency analysis to tackle the cipher, by studying the relative frequencies of pairs of letters in the ciphertext. To help you we have republished the challenge with the ciphertext broken into pairs. Of course counting the pairs by hand is an arduous task, so to help you we have published an alphabetical list of the digraphs that occur (with repetitions) so you can count them more easily. You can download this text file here. Remember that the commonest digraphs in English are: th, he, an, in, er, re and es.
If you are still having trouble over the weekend look for another hint on Monday!
