OK here's another HINT for those of you having trouble:

You already know this is a Playfair cipher, so there is a keyword defining a 5x5 grid which you need to reconstruct in order to crack the cipher. The first thing to note is that there are 26 letters in the alphabet and only 25 places to put them, so by the "pigeonhole principle" you have to put two of the letters in the same spot. Usually cryptographers put I and J together in one block of the grid, but we have been a little sneaky and chosen another pair! The quickest way to solve the cipher is to succesfully guess the keyword we used to start filling in the grid. There is a clue in the plaintext part of this challenge and you should use all your keen powers of deduction to work it out. If you still can't we will give you another clue as to what's on where this Thursday!
