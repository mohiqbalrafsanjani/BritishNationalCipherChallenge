Dear B,

I trust you enjoyed your holiday touring Europe. What a most ingenious idea to send me a beautiful aquatint of the Reichenbach Falls on a card with a message and the address on the back. Such cards sold in holiday resorts could become a popular and inexpensive way of conveying to friends and family an informative impression of one's holiday. I was also most impressed that you wrote the card in German. Clearly you have secured an improvement in this language since your grand tour.

I was at the Drury Lane Theatre last week where the Crummles Stage Company was performing and came across W in deep conversation with Mr Playfair who has just returned from a visit to India. It is good to find W in such good spirits. He has recently returned from a holiday in the New Forest and his spirits have been restored after the unpleasant business at The Monument. He has returned to his old enthusiasms. In his conversation with Mr Playfair he was discoursing on a new cipher based on pairs of letters that he thinks will prove very useful for the simple and secure transmission of messages by electric telegraph now that Mr Morse has developed a fast and simple way of transmitting messages. He is keen that it is not revealed beyond our immediate circle. It is very ingenious and I have used it to encipher the accompanying attachment.

Yours truly, L
