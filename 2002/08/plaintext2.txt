Sir,

It is with pleasure that I accept your offer to discuss the value of
the material concerning the English encryption engine on behalf of
my master, CD.

As you can see, I have moved from Southampton to an address in London,
and suggest you should meet me there at noon a week on Wednesday. Please
come alone, as I fear the material is, shall we say inflammable. It would
be most unfortunate if, as a result of an attack of nerves, I were to
knock over a lantern, or perhaps drop a lighted cigar in the vicinity
of the stock of chemicals I have stored here. Chemistry is such a
pleasant diversion for the curious mind, and with so many fascinating and
rather pleasing applications in the modern world. I'm sure you will agree.

Of course, the pleasure in such a transaction is necessarily mutual, and
I hope that all unpleasantness avoided. I will be able to satisfy your
curiosity concerning Prof. Babbage's device, and you will be able to
satisfy my master's need for currency. As a gentleman, I am sure he felt
unable to discuss terms with you, but as his faithful servant, I must, of
course, endeavour to arrive at an agreement favourable to him. I trust we
understand one another, and that our meeting will indeed be a pleasure for
us both.

Please reply in the usual fashion.

Yours, ES
