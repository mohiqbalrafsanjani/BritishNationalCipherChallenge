By hand:

My dear Mr. Babbage,

Real progress with our campaign: I believe the enclosed message was enclosed
in a diplomatic communique and seems to betray the location of the stolen
diagrams, though my friend has reason to believe that the message itself is
not of French origin. If the treacherous French government are involved in
this affair, then I fear we must be even more careful. We should use the
French cipher ourselves. If we use a keyword longer than the three letters
they customarily seem to use, then our letters should be safe.

Yours respectfully, L
