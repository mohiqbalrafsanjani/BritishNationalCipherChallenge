MESSAGE 13 CLUE
You know this is a Playfair cipher, or you should do if you were paying attention. The solution to last week's challenge tells you that we have used a slightly non-standard version including the numbers 0-9 as well. If you translate the first line of the German you might even be able to guess at the first few words of the message, and that should get you started with the decryption. After that you probably need to do digraph analysis as before. More clues next week! By the way, we know the message ends strangely! Just submit your decryption of the ciphertext as shown in the challenge. The last bit comes out later!
