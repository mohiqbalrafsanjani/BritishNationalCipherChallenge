My Dear W,

The countess has informed me that the plans have disappeared and that you are
on their trail. From discreet enquiries with her society friends in the
foreign office it appears that the rogue Spion has contacted French agents.
His flight to Southampton might mean that he plans to escape back to France.
If only there were peelers in Southampton to assist you. It occurs to me that
an electric telegraphic device based on our turning machine might be useful in
the apprehension of such rogues in the future, though doubtless this engine
mail, as I call it, will be the cause of much idle gossip, too. Be sure that
the rogue is lying low and you will have to be assiduous in your enquiries if
you are to find him. The countess has kindly placed an advertisement in the
national press. She has high hopes that it will yield new avenues of enquiry.

Yours as ever, Chas
