my dear brothers,

ingenuity, duplicity, secrecy, if i may paraphrase our own dear song of
liberation, as you can see, the english cipher machine obtained at such
great expense is now ours to command. i must congratulate all those
involved in contributing to this masterful coup de main.

the new cipher is beyond doubt the most ingenious and the most secure
in the world today, and messages enciphered using its rotary mechanism
will frustrate the efforts of the most ardent cryptanalysts for years
to come.

in the meantime, our own efforts must go to the frustration of those who
would develop rival machines, given the history of M. Babbage, a man for
whom the word dilettante was invented. a campaign of gentle sabotage may
be sufficient to prevent his own machine from reaching completion.

it is with some sadness that i bring this letter to a close. i have enjoyed
the battle of wits in which we have been engaged, and feel a little sorrow
that with the completion of the turning machine the battle must draw to a
close. yet, who knows, perhaps another time we will engage once more in a
war of the mind: another cryptographic challenge with those ingenious and
dedicated english mathematicians.

vive la france
