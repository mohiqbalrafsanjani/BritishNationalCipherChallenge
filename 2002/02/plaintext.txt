My Dear Charles,

Thank you so much for the splendid meal last night. Please send my sincere
compliments to your cook Mrs. Beeton. I was most wonderfully entertained
by the street vagabonds playing their instruments under the dining room
windows, though the countess seemed to find them somewhat amusing. The idea
of your turning machine is most ingenious, and I am sure it could be of great
importance to the security of the empire.

On a more serious note, I am afraid to report that a foreign gentleman has
been making somewhat indiscreet enquiries about your work on ciphers. He made
no mention of the device, but something about his manner concerned me. I fear
we should be more careful. Nevertheless, be assured that the draft plans of
the turning machine that you kindly lent me last night are kept with the
greatest security.

Yours, W
