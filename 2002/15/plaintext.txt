my dear friends

great news: my friend close to the french embassy has just told me
that they have taken delivery of their new enciphering machine
through the good offices of one of the servants induced by a
modest emolument he was able to gain access to the device and to
study its construction the design of the machine follows our own
plans most faithfully the two rotors and the reflector board are
both present my friend's description of the machine follows:

on pressing a key on the keyboard current flowed through wiring
in the first rotor embedded in some form of glass insulation
passing as input to the second rotor again it appeared to flow
through wiring in the second rotor wherupon it passed through a
maze of wiring the purpose of which was unclear to me since it
connected back to the second rotor current then flowed back through
the rotors in reverse order wherupon it activated a small indicator
arrow which pointed to one of the thirty-six possible alphanumeric
outputs upon releasing the key the first rotor moved on one position
and the machine then rested i repeatedly pressed on the keys and
noticed that the first rotor turns at every character input whilst
the second turned every thirty-six the machine has one additional
key marked fine and upon pressing it the rotors moved back to their
starting position with the character a uppermost upon both i spent
some time trying to fathom the internal wiring of the rotors i will
pass this together with the wiring in the maze to you in a separate
document enciphered with your ingenious really secure artifice
using the professor's public key

of course what our friend describes as a maze is in fact the wiring
of the reflector owing to the fact that glass was used as the
insulating layer in the rotors much of the wiring is now known to
us though it appears that ten of the pairings in the second rotor
were undetermined i understand that a sudden noise led to the rather
precipitous departure of our own precious spy

i have left the best news until last our agent spied in the fire
grate what he believes to be a burnt fragment of the plaintext
corresponding to a ciphertext he found lying by the machine this
discovery provides us with a wonderful opportunity to exploit the
machine's weakness as outlined in w's last message i will send the
plaintext fragment and the enciphered text together with the known
wirings in my next message

yours truly
