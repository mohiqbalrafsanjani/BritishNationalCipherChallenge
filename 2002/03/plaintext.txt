Addressee's eyes only.

My Dear W,

Thank you for your kind, though somewhat ill-advised note. Unfortunately, I
must remind you to take more care with encryption. Realistically, we must be
much more careful. Never reveal the word structure in an enciphered text, as
it weakens the security. It may otherwise afford--indeed I was denied any--
modicum of pleasure in deciphering your entirely transparent cipher.

Now I must inform you that I may have encountered your mysterious
interlocuter: a street musician by the name of M. Edouard Spion. Generosity
forbids me to presume he means any harm, but his habit of playing a
new-fangled German accordion by the window of my study fills me with alarm,
not to mention the assault on my sensibilities, and I fear it is possible that
he is working for the French government. To ensure that he is unable to
intercept our communications, I suggest that the next one should be encrypted
using a keyword substitution cipher. The keyword is characterised by my initial
remarks herein.

Yours as ever, Chas

P.S. My petitions to the government for further advances to finish the
difference engine and develop my analytical engine remain ignored. The death
of the king last year and the accession of our new Queen Victoria and her
coronation this June have proved a distraction. Perhaps the turning machine
will excite more interest from Lord Melbourne and his cabinet.
