Friends,

It was with some shock that I recognized the initials in the last
communique. I know of this rogue and his reputation, but did not think
that even the French would stoop to collaboration with such a diabolical
rogue. It may be possible to act in law to retrieve the plans, but I
fear that the notorious case of Jarndyce and Jarndyce suggests that the
law courts are not the most effective instruments when speedy action
is required. Indeed, as far as I can tell, that awful case could make
only a lawyer happy, or perhaps a journalist with an eye for narrative.
The very nature of this disloyal rogue may be our good fortune. I
understand that the rogue has recently lost very heavily by gambling at
cards and on the horses, and is therefore likely to be in want of funds.
This might well provide us with a good opportunity to reacquire the
plans by means of a more commercial transaction. However, I fear that
he will demand a price that is beyond our resources. What are your
thoughts on this matter?

Yours, W
