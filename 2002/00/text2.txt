The story so far . . .
In 1838 Queen Victoria has just been crowned and three of the greatest British scientific minds of the 19th century dream up the idea of a sophisticated and revolutionary mechanical cipher machine - an idea about a hundred years ahead of its time - that threatens to upset the international political balance. Their machine inevitably attracts the attention of a foreign power that is out to steal the idea for its own ends. Follow this adventure by cracking their coded correspondence on our Cipher Challenge trail! Be the first to crack each message and you and your school will each win a prize from the Â£10,000 total prize fund.
