Mission Intercept 5B: Transatlantic

I think BOSS might suspect something. They drafted the report on the Lighthouse discovery over a month ago and have still not forwarded a summary to us here in the US. I can't risk making enquiries through the usual channels but I think we need to investigate.
I am disappointed that the Trinity team left files in the basement when they shipped out, but they did not have a lot of warning, and at least they don't seem to have left anything current for Harry to find. If they had he wouldn't have passed the investigation to the Archaeologists, it would have gone straight upstairs for action.
I am in two minds about it. If anyone else was investigating, I would say we should ignore it. They are unlikely to make much of a historical curiosity, but if anyone could trace the link to us now then Harry and Jodie are the ones to do it. Jodie is a terrier who won't let anything go once she has her teeth into it, and Harry has been around long enough to know when something trivial is actually important. On balance I think I will need to be on the ground where I can hope to influence the direction of their enquiries.
For the good of everyone we need to keep a very low profile, at least while the BOSS investigation is hot, so unless the system flags a real crisis we will have to dial down our activities for a while. We will carry on with forecasts, but will not act on them unless the threat level rises to ten. Even then, the Curia will need to meet to decide whether it is wise to take action.
I will head to London to take charge of misdirection. You can contact me at the Embassy.
Charlie.
