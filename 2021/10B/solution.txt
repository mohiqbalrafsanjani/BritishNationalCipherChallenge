cipher: modified Playfair

The modifications are:
 - the grid is 6x6
 - the characters are ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789
 - when the two plaintext characters of a pair are in the same row or
   same column, then the ciphertext characters are taken from one row
   above (with wraparound, so row 1 -> row 6)
 - '0' is used to break up repeated letters in stead of 'X'

grid:
  P E A K O F
  H V N Q R S
  T U W X Y Z
  B C D G I J
  L M 0 1 2 3
  4 5 6 7 8 9
