elliot has done himself no favours in arguing the pragmatic line at
the constantinople conference disraeli caught the mood with his
pamphlet and the people do not seem to agree that bulgarian lives
count for less in the calculus of international affairs i think
salisbury plans to move him on perhaps back to vienna he was successful
there it is most unusual to have annoyed both salisbury and gladstone
but i have some sympathy with his views the terrible events that have
precipitated this crisis cannot be undone and there are other
considerations

russian aggression must still be impeded if we are to retain our
influence in the region my agents tell me that the russian emperor
met with the austrians at budapest at the start of the year to
discuss their intentions in the event of war and it is rumoured
that they plan to restructure the balkans in an effort to control
the slavic moves for a unified state it is my own view that the
slavs may be a most useful ally in blocking the expansionist movement
in russia and i have advised the government to invite the austrians
to join us in march to see if we can effect a diplomatic solution
to untangle this gordian knot perhaps we can find something more
attractive for them that will weaken their dependence on tsar
alexander ii if we fail then i fear that more direct action may need
to be taken i have in my possession copies of certain letters that
have been circulating in franz josef's court that i think might be
sufficiently embarrassing

to concentrate minds on the advantages of working with us instability
in the region is certainly something to be feared but perhaps we can
convince the austrians that stability would be worse if it is secured
by the russians if we cannot turn austria to our cause it might be
necessary to undertake a campaign to stir up the local populations
perhaps russia would think twice before getting involved if they were
not able to secure a stable settlement

by force of arms alone the lessons of the crimea have not been
forgotten by any of its combatants modern warfare is growing
industrial in its scale and the costs of conflict are prohibitive
i am certain that the stories told by nightingale of the horrific
wounds suffered there have softened the appetite of some for open
conflict and perhaps that is responsible for her majesty's support
of the shadow archive and all its works i must not let her down
nor the empire
