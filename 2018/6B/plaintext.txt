infiltrating the deliberations of our enemies is a principal goal
but following my discussions with playfair i have come to see that
the classical strategy of trying to turn a senior member of the
delegations is both risky and unnecessary any approach to such an
individual risks signalling our intentions and undermines our
ability to adapt our plan's secrecy is everything as playfair
points out those individuals often have little influence anyway
they are there to present a point of view and the best of them at
least to listen but they have little authority the junior officials
on the other hand have almost total control of events they set the
agenda in discussion with one another and their seniors and more
importantly they take the record of the meeting after the delegates
have returned to their homes it is that record that becomes the
reality we do not need to be there or even to know what was said
we need only to know what has been recorded as the truth and where
possible to shape that truth in our best interests this i believe
to be an entirely new strategy in the world of diplomacy and i am
pleased to be able to develop it with the help of such a distinguished
friend playfair is a man of cunning and i enjoy working with him
nowhere has this cunning been more effective than in his strategy
for the management of the reichstadt meeting alexander franz josef
gorchakov and andrassy met to agree terms on russia's involvement
in the balkans and there was a real risk that they would unite and
fight to control our trade routes with such high-level involvement
in the discussions it was clear that we would have little to no hope
of influencing the principals and so we decided to follow the playfair
strategy applying careful pressure to the junior members of the
retinues our agents and officers persuaded them to report on the
proceedings providing us with the intelligence we needed to prepare
for the forthcoming war between russia and the ottoman empire but
of far greater significance they were able to ensure maximum confusion
among our enemies by the most marvellous stratagem which i will refer
to as the playfair gambit the officials were able to persuade their
leaders that it would be better not to take official minutes of the
meeting while we received a full and accurate account of all the
discussions the russian and austrohungarian officials were left only
with informal personal notes of the discussions and no agreed record
of the meeting or its agreed outcomes we fully intend to exploit
this uncertainty at the forthcoming conference in constantinople
