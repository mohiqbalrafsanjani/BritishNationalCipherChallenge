i am still not sure which of the two came up with the idea of the
underground archive it will have appealed to black as a way to
provide security to his operation but a civil engineering project
of this scale doesn't seem like his sort of thing so i think it
must have been conceived by charles grey the first tube line had
been opened in and london was full of labourers and engineers with
the skills needed to build the shadow archive deep beneath new
scotland yard

getting access was not going to be easy without harry's help but i
still didn't have enough to give him the excuse he would need to
get openly involved my reconnaissance had helped me to find the
archive but it didn't give me any obvious way in the duct that had
cost me the lidar was far too narrow for me to scale and access
through the front door was too risky so i took a gamble and spent
another miserable fortnight exploring the labyrinth of sewers and
tunnel systems around the neighbourhood gps was useless down there
and i could easily have got lost but i marked the tunnels and on
occasions used theseus' trick of a ball of twine to help me navigate
back i moved quietly and kept an eye out for sensors i had no idea
whether the shadow archive was still operational or not but if it
was then security would be tight and i couldn't be sure if they were
using infrared or seismometers for intrusion detection so i layered
up with insulation and moved slowly it was horrible i was hot damp
and the air smelled of sewage and mould

i was just about to give up when i found a steeldoormarked with the
initials vri victoria regina imperatrix it was incongruous in that
dark and dank tunnel but more significantly it carried the trademark
tann on the lock john tann was one of the top safe makers in
victorian london and i had cracked one or two of his safes in my
other life as a catburglar this was big and heavy and very rusty
that told me two things no one had used it in a very long time and
no one had upgraded it in just as long if the room behind it was
still in use then someone would have been maintaining the lock so
all my precautions were probably unnecessary but no one had paid
for a tann safe without something important to hide so i decided
to tackle the lock and after another eighteen hours of grim work
i was in i had found the shadow archive
