the russoturkish war has been all that we feared russia has played her
hand perfectly building support for action with her allies in germany
and austria and effectively marginalising the british position while
appearing to be amenable to an international solution our strategy of
sowing confusion among the allies worked to delay the inevitable and i
comfort myself that this delay achieved two: things first we were able
to develop our agent network within the diplomatic services of our
enemies and second we were able to begin to negotiate with other leading
powers to present our own solution to the turkish problem nonetheless
my methods have not been universally popular in whitehall and i have
expended considerable energy fighting enemies within now finally with
the prospect that peace might be bought at the impending congress in
berlin i can begin to hope for a resolution when i said this to playfair
he corrected me and said that i must surely mean brought but it is my
view that all victories worth winning are bought and often at great cost
my hope is that our new methods of diplomacy might succeed at a much
lower cost in lives

all of the major powers have begun to see the gathering threat that war
may erupt across the continent and all have realised that they have
something more to lose from further conflict if we can control the
agenda at berlin then i believe we may see a way out of the crisis

the panslavic movement aims to unite the slavic states in the same way
that germany and italy have been unified but is deeply split between
those who believe that the locus of its power should lie within russia
and those who seek a balkan solution the balkan states themselves remain
divided with varied cultural and political ambitions of their own and
no clear idea of which party should lead the unification perhaps that
is misleading it is not that they lack a clear idea but rather that
there are very many rival views and these are incompatible the question
of how and whether this unification might be achieved is the principle
concern of the congress all of the major powers will i am sure have a
view but my focus is on the smaller states and parties

my agents across the balkans have nurtured instability in the hope that
we can bring pressure to bear through them on the major powers of course
the frenzied atmosphere of the diplomatic bazaar in germany will be rich
in trading opportunities and i have heard rumours that we may gain cyprus
cementing our control of the mediterranean trade routes at the same time
by trading macedonia back to the ottoman state we hope to undermine
russian territorial gains and perhaps to settle the balkan question
permanently if so our agent network in bosnia will give us a foothold
in that region i will continue to work closely with them in the hope of
creating a new and more secure future
