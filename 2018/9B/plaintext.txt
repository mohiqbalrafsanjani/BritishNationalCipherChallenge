THE RUSSO-TURKISH WAR HAS BEEN ALL THAT WE FEARED. RUSSIA HAS PLAYED HER HAND PERFECTLY, BUILDING SUPPORT FOR ACTION WITH HER ALLIES IN GERMANY AND AUSTRIA AND EFFECTIVELY MARGINALISING THE BRITISH POSITION, WHILE APPEARING TO BE AMENABLE TO AN INTERNATIONAL SOLUTION. OUR STRATEGY OF SOWING CONFUSION AMONG THE ALLIES WORKED TO DELAY THE INEVITABLE, AND I COMFORT MYSELF THAT THIS DELAY ACHIEVED TWO THINGS. FIRST WE WERE ABLE TO DEVELOP OUR AGENT NETWORK WITHIN THE DIPLOMATIC SERVICES OF OUR ENEMIES, AND SECOND WE WERE ABLE TO BEGIN TO NEGOTIATE WITH OTHER LEADING POWERS TO PRESENT OUR OWN SOLUTION TO THE TURKISH PROBLEM. NONETHELESS MY METHODS HAVE NOT BEEN UNIVERSALLY POPULAR IN WHITEHALL, AND I HAVE EXPENDED CONSIDERABLE ENERGY FIGHTING ENEMIES WITHIN. NOW, FINALLY, WITH THE PROSPECT THAT PEACE MIGHT BE BOUGHT AT THE IMPENDING CONGRESS IN BERLIN, I CAN BEGIN TO HOPE FOR A RESOLUTION. WHEN I SAID THIS TO PLAYFAIR HE CORRECTED ME AND SAID THAT I MUST SURELY MEAN “BROUGHT”, BUT IT IS MY VIEW THAT ALL VICTORIES WORTH WINNING ARE BOUGHT, AND OFTEN AT GREAT COST. MY HOPE IS THAT OUR NEW METHODS OF DIPLOMACY MIGHT SUCCEED AT A MUCH LOWER COST IN LIVES.
ALL OF THE MAJOR POWERS HAVE BEGUN TO SEE THE GATHERING THREAT THAT WAR MAY ERUPT ACROSS THE CONTINENT, AND ALL HAVE REALISED THAT THEY HAVE SOMETHING MORE TO LOSE FROM FURTHER CONFLICT. IF WE CAN CONTROL THE AGENDA AT BERLIN, THEN I BELIEVE WE MAY SEE A WAY OUT OF THE CRISIS.
THE PAN-SLAVIC MOVEMENT AIMS TO UNITE THE SLAVIC STATES IN THE SAME WAY THAT GERMANY AND ITALY HAVE BEEN UNIFIED, BUT IS DEEPLY SPLIT, BETWEEN THOSE WHO BELIEVE THAT THE LOCUS OF ITS POWER SHOULD LIE WITHIN RUSSIA AND THOSE WHO SEEK A BALKAN SOLUTION. THE BALKAN STATES THEMSELVES REMAIN DIVIDED, WITH VARIED CULTURAL AND POLITICAL AMBITIONS OF THEIR OWN, AND NO CLEAR IDEA OF WHICH PARTY SHOULD LEAD THE UNIFICATION.
PERHAPS THAT IS MISLEADING. IT IS NOT THAT THEY LACK A CLEAR IDEA, BUT RATHER THAT THERE ARE VERY MANY RIVAL VIEWS, AND THESE ARE INCOMPATIBLE. THE QUESTION OF HOW AND WHETHER THIS UNIFICATION MIGHT BE ACHIEVED IS THE PRINCIPLE CONCERN OF THE CONGRESS.
ALL OF THE MAJOR POWERS WILL, I AM SURE, HAVE A VIEW, BUT MY FOCUS IS ON THE SMALLER STATES AND PARTIES. MY AGENTS ACROSS THE BALKANS HAVE NURTURED INSTABILITY IN THE HOPE THAT WE CAN BRING PRESSURE TO BEAR, THROUGH THEM, ON THE MAJOR POWERS. OF COURSE THE FRENZIED ATMOSPHERE OF THE DIPLOMATIC BAZAAR IN GERMANY WILL BE RICH IN TRADING OPPORTUNITIES, AND I HAVE HEARD RUMOURS THAT WE MAY GAIN CYPRUS, CEMENTING OUR CONTROL OF THE MEDITERRANEAN TRADE ROUTES. AT THE SAME TIME, BY TRADING MACEDONIA BACK TO THE OTTOMAN STATE WE HOPE TO UNDERMINE RUSSIAN TERRITORIAL GAINS AND PERHAPS TO SETTLE THE BALKAN QUESTION PERMANENTLY. IF SO, OUR AGENT NETWORK IN BOSNIA WILL GIVE US A FOOTHOLD IN THAT REGION. I WILL CONTINUE TO WORK CLOSELY WITH THEM IN THE HOPE OF CREATING A NEW AND MORE SECURE FUTURE.
