the chaos and confusion that followed the reichstadt meeting was
more complete than i had any right to hope the playfair gambit was
an outstanding success the delegates from russia and austrohungary
each had a clear view of what had been agreed and these views were
entirely divergent even better the records of the meeting were
entirely independent of one another at the urging of our agents
within the separate courts the minutes were dictated separately by
the two foreign ministers andrassy and gorchakov so as to ensure
the deepest possible understanding of the agreed outcomes there
was no signed formal convention nor even an agreed protocol our
subtle campaign of whispers and misdirection ensured that neither
side entirely trusted the other so these minutes were never shared

the discussions concerning austrian annexation in bosnia and
herzegovenia will confuse historians and diplomats for generations
to come it has already confused the principals in this affair and
no one in the foreign office can make sense of them at all despite
the great care taken by the officers of the shadow archive to record
them accurately

there is talk of the need for further meetings of the great powers
and this time i will make sure that britain will be at the table to
influence the deliberations and to protect our interests from the
point of view of her majesty and the prime minister if not that of
all her ministers

this is close to the perfect outcome discussion is displacing war
and low-level distrust is inhibiting the sort of organised alliance
that might diminish our influence over the gateway to the east the
forthcoming conference in constantinople will for the first time
involve our government in the discussions concerning the future
governance of the region lord salisbury will argue for the creation
of autonomous regions under bulgarian rule in the hope of reducing
tensions and eliminating the excuse that russia needs to engage in
war if he succeeds then we will have established a comprehensive
agreement with russia concerning its territorial ambitions in central
asia resolving the conflict with our own strategic aims even if this
proves to be too much for our negotiators we can at least hope to
buy time to make our own preparations and to manipulate our allies
and enemies

i will concentrate on developing further confusion spreading
misinformation and as much distrust as i can manage if the talks
fail we should at least ensure that no grand bargain is struck
against our interests and no major alliance is formed to diminish
us the mediterranean is a chokepoint for the trade routes from
the east we cannot and will not allow others to strangle the flow
of goods and people that enrich us no threat is greater to the
health of the empire and no action is beyond contemplation in our
efforts to remove the threat
