Life returns to normal

After last year's adventures in Turkey, tracking down the true story of the Lost Legion, I needed a break, and Harry fixed up the perfect gig for me. He found out that the British Library were cataloguing old foreign policy papers from the time of Queen Victoria and they needed a forgery expert to help them with provenance. He didn't tell them that I was an expert at forgery in two entirely different ways!

Anyway I settled into the work and got really into spying over Queen Vic's shoulder, but after a bit I started to miss the adventure of working in Harry's world. I should have been more careful what I wished for. I didn't know it, but I was about to be hit by The Krompromat Files.
