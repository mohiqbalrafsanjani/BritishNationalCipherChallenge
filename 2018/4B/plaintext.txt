charles is right the threats to the east are growing by the day in the
southern region the ottomans are restless and in the north the three
emperors are a growing threat to our influence the foreign office seem
paralysed focussed entirely on forming alliances and unable to determine
their best strategy i think they are mistaken in their outlook they
focus too much on treaties and not enough on real politik as von
rochau wrote the law of power governs the world of states just as the
law of gravity governs the physical world and we are perhaps too much
inclined to overlook the real might of the more powerful and the
inevitability of its political influence our task now is not to choose
a favoured partner to control the others that way risks war an alliance
will encourage a counter-alliance and a dangerous escalation instead
our strategy should be to maintain an admittedly uneasy peace between
the emperors together they are the biggest political threat to our
empire but as enemies of one another they also threaten our trading
routes we need to induce them to work together while preventing them
from forming a power bloc against our interest our most important weapon
in this is confusion and mild distrust the best outcome would be to
encourage a dysfunctional alliance between all three that makes it hard
for the emperors to fight one another or us and in the ottoman crisis
i think i sense an opportunity to do just that
