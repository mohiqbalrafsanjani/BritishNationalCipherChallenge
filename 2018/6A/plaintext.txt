it was dark and dusty in the shadow archive but at least i had found
it the shelves marched off into the gloom and most of them were empty
though there was the occasional box of papers marked SA which had
clearly been forgotten in the move they would be interesting to read
later but nothing in them looked important enough to have excited my
coconspirator whoever that might be

it would have been easy to get discouraged but i needed to recover the
lidar so i carried on searching for the chimney i eventually found it
at the back of the stacks but there was no sign of the lidar or of any
disturbance to suggest it had fallen that far so i guessed it might
have got caught on a ledge higher up fortunately the chimney was fairly
wide but not so wide that i couldn't bridge it and all those hours on
the climbing wall paid off as i climbed up looking for the lost machine
as i suspected it had caught on one of the ledges designed to catch
rain so i made ready to lower it back down but as i moved loose bricks
to steady myself part of the inner wall collapsed and to my amazement
i found myself staring into a control room it was very jules verne and
wouldn't have looked out of place on the bridge of the nautilus it must
have been cutting-edge technology once all brass and polished instruments
there was a map on the wall covered in small bulbs that i assumed would
have lit up to signify activity and a bank of fine nineteenth-century
telegraph machines in polished walnut unless i was mistaken i had found
douglas black's command centre

under a large circular oak table in the centre of the room there was a
filing system with drawers containing maps of every nation and the
table could be turned like a restaurant lazy susan the walls were lined
with brass-bound ledgers and folders marked with what looked like mission
code names in amongst them was the most amazing find black's codebook
it contained a number of keys and best of all a list of ciphers and when
and how they should be used it would be worth a fortune on the bibliophile
black market but i didn't feel like selling it harry might be interested
if only for historical reasons but if not then this would find a home
in my own private collection

i took a seat by the telegraph and put my feet up opening the codebook
at random to read:

    as with the three emperor's operation it may be necessary to enhance
    operational security during the operation itself in that case we
    moved from purely letter substitution cryptograms to transposition
    ciphers and at the urging of baron playfair other more complicated
    ciphers like the vigenere and playfair ciphers and variants upon them

i was completely immersed in what i was reading and then it hit me
