Can be viewed as a periodic substitution cipher (sliced like a Vigenere cipher,
where each slice is encrypted with a general substitution cipher)
    period = 7

Harry calls the cipher a "keyed Vigenere cipher".
This works if the Vigenere key is ARCHIVE and the alphabet is
SHADOWBCEFGIJKLMNPQRTUVXYZ, so that the two keywords are
SHADOW and ARCHIVE. Note that we must take A=1, B=2, ...,
instead of what we usually do (A=0, B=1, ...).

It can also be viewed as a triple cipher, a Vigenere between two monoalphabetic
substitution ciphers. To decrypt fully, first decrypt as a substitution cipher
with key SHADOWBCEFGIJKLMNPQRTUVXYZ (keyword = SHADOW), then decrypt as a
Vigenere with the key BSDIJWF (= ARCHIVE + 1,1,1,1,1,1,1), then reencrypt as a
substitution with key SHADOWBCEFGIJKLMNPQRTUVXYZ (keyword = SHADOW).
