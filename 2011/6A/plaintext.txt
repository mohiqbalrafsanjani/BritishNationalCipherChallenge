i told my grandma all about the tempest conspiracy did you know she
used to work in the security services she said she had never heard
of it but she has a friend she called harry probably not his real
name who is still on the edges of that community and she reckoned
he might be able to help she also asked some people at her old place
to keep an eye out for us and watch for anything unusual

they took my computer in for analysis to see if they could find any
more info about the hacker

in the meantime i have been working more on the turing papers and
reading some old newspapers trying to pick up any trail left by
tempest i figured i should look for big shifts in stock prices moved
by historic events but there are quite a few of those as you might
expect but then i thought some more about turing's remarks concerning
their use of intelligence and began to wonder what he meant when he
said they invented their own distribution network smuggling secrets
across the world in music manuscripts using steganography
steganography is the art of hiding a message so i figure the
encryption was disguised but it was the word smuggled that got me
what would be the best way to hide the music manuscript seems risky
to me

grandma charlie remembered a case in new york in the fifties when
a gambling syndicate tried to disguise a porta cipher in musical
notation but got caught when a cop who played piano noticed how odd
the music looked i figured that tempest are too clever to risk that
but grandma reminded me about the story the purloined letter remember
what dupin said perhaps the mystery is a little too plain i think i
may know how they did it

more later
