alert all tempest agents

monitoring stations have picked up chatter in texts and email traffic
in which the following keywords are repeated and adjacent:

    turing tempest assassination

all stations in the south are to increase resolution on traces and
triangulate on sources using these triggers surveillance and housekeeping
teams in southern region to standby for immediate action all leave
cancelled in the lead-in to the turing centenary

it is still possible that the text adjacencies are coincidental however
the turing incident was the last time our organisation faced serious
threat we have operated for the last seventy years without discovery
and it is essential that we terminate any nascent investigations
immediately and with the highest discretion no contact to be made
without direct clearance from my office all reports eyes only direct
to me using level encryption keyword substitution or transposition only
blocks of keywords to be taken from the music dictionary as usual
