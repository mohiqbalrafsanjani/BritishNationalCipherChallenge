the tempest conspiracy appears to have one goal and two instruments
their goal is to profit from movements in the price of commodities
the instruments they wield in order to achieve this goal are
intelligence and terror

the assassination attempts that i have uncovered as the work of the
conspiracy were never intended to succeed indeed i am sure that the
conspirators knew that if they did succeed the result would be highly
unpredictable and it would be hard to benefit from the chaos that
ensued the likely effect of a failed assassination was more amenable
to analysis the steady decline in confidence in the years following
the attempted assassination on victoria led to a decline in the
national product of around fourteen percent in four years from five
hundred and eighty-two million to five hundred million pounds similarly
the attempt on andrew jackson's life was followed by an increase in
the short-term interest rate in the united states from seven percent
to over eighteen percent it is clear that those with foreknowledge of
these significant events would have been well placed to plan to benefit
from them

to truly take advantage of them however the conspiracy developed a
second instrument tempest is an intelligence network capable of
eavesdropping on the secret communications of government and commerce
which exploited the introduction of wheatstone's electric telegraph
aware of the risk that their own communications might be intercepted
they invented their own distribution network smuggling secrets across
the world in music manuscripts using steganography to hide their
cunningly encrypted texts

by nineteen fourteen they felt sufficiently confident in their ability
to profit from chaos that they triggered the great war sponsoring the
assassination of archduke ferdinand in sarajevo they subsequently made
huge profits from both sides in the conflict in the post-war years
they triggered hyperinflation in the weimar republic leading ultimately
to the current conflict

they appear to have penetrated our own government and the institutions
of the city and i am unsure who i can trust with this information

i am exhausted by the work required to break the communication systems
in use by the axis forces and find myself unable to invest the time and
energy needed to complete my investigations into tempest

i will update these notes on the conspiracy as time allows but for now
i must turn my full attention to the bombe
