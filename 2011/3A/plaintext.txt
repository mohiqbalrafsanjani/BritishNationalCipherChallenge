this is dynamite turing was one of the top codebreakers in the war
and he seems to have uncovered some huge conspiracy going back years
i read on in his notebook and discovered the following porta's cipher
was rather obviously detected since the musical notation employed
resulted in music that to anyone with any knowledge was obviously
artificial thicknesse's variation led to music that was somewhat more
plausible to the untrained eye and would have passed muster at the
sort of inspections likely to be given at borders historically
tempest seem to have used a variant on these schemes which has gained
in sophistication over time and seems to have allowed them to
communicate with impunity for over one hundred years it is pretty
clear that he was onto something with tempest but it is not clear why
his research was hidden up on the roof maybe he was scared that they
were on to him i wouldn't want some ancient assassination cult
chasing me just because they heard we were onto them either guess we
should keep our eyes open just kidding
