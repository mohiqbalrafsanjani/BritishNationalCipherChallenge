my discoveries concerning the tempest conspiracy have led me to a
terrifying conclusion. this is no historic curiosity. the conspiracy
is alive and well in the modern world and may, in part, be responsible
for this terrible war. they seem to have had a hand in every major
conflict in the past 140 years, finding ways to profit from the misery
they have inflicted. i will try to set out in this notebook all that i
have uncovered in the hope that someone will find a way to bring the
conspiracy to account for its actions. my initial enquiries were
triggered by the discovery of a cipher hidden in the manuscript of
malgoire's "les paladins". the cipher itself was truly elementary, but
the manner of its concealment in musical notation was unusual and
ingenious and piqued my curiosity. on deciphering it i discovered what
appeared to be plans for the assassination of bonaparte, dating from
around 1799, and referring to the "machine infernale". the papers
discussed the profits that might follow from the demonstration of the
terrifying effectiveness of the weapon. startling though this find was,
the comparison with the terrors of this current war made it seem of merely
passing interest. however a further accidental discovery led me to another
manuscript from the same period, which also contained detailed plans of
another assassination attempt. this time the object of the plot was our
own prime minister, the right honourable spencer perceval. his opposition
to bonaparte made him an unlikely target of the same conspirators, and yet
the similarity in the method of encryption and concealment of the cipher
seemed too much of a coincidence. i began to suspect that our conspirators
may have had more sinister, more mercenary, objectives and an international
organisation. and in this way began my obsession with the tempest conspiracy.
