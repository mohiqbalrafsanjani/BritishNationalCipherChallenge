ok, i took a look at that notebook you sent over. i can see why it
was so well hidden. whoever wrote it hadn't bothered encrypting it
securely at all, so i don't think it can originally have been official
work. on the other hand given the talk about the war, and given the
location i have a feeling i know who amt might have been. there was
a night climbing club at cambridge back in the 30's, so maybe that was
how amt got the idea of hiding things up on the roof at bletchley.
clearly he was worried about tempest and, if amt was who i think it
was, then it will definitely be worth trying to find out more.

i looked at the next bit in the book, and it is clear that he was in a
hurry; the encryption isn't a lot harder to crack in that either. i guess,
with security so tight back then, he wasn't worried about anyone reading
the notebook. they would have assumed it was work related and would know
better than to pry. on the other hand he clearly didn't want anyone
stumbling on it by accident so he wrote this part up in an affine shift
cipher. it would be a lot harder to crack without the word structure.

anyway, it is clear that amt believed that tempest were still active in
the forties and that they were involved in assassination attempts for a
while before that. i am not sure how they were supposed to profit from
that, but maybe if we read on we will find out. funny how they seem to
have used music notation in their ciphers. i wonder how. maybe there is
something about it later in the book. was there anything else in the packet
you found?
