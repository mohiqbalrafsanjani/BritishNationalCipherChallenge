i am sorry you have been caught up in all this trouble the tempest
conspiracy is an established criminal terrorist agency and mixing
with them is always bad news

intelligence agencies across the world have been trying to nail them
for nearly two hundred years without any success turing came close
when he broke their ciphers in the war but we didn't have the
resources to take them on then with the onset of the cold war tempest
were a fairly low priority but the recent collapse in world markets
coinciding with your discovery of turing's papers has enabled me to
get security agencies on both sides of the atlantic to take them
seriously again

it is lucky i did with gchq help we have been able to monitor tempest
communications and we know that they are tracking you i am afraid you
really will have to disappear for a while we have arranged for you to
have won a fully funded gap year with a charity in central america
run by the united nations operatives in the un will run cover and
channel communications between you and your families while we try to
figure out what to do next but given the reach of tempest it would be
unsafe to lodge you there really instead we plan to give you new
identities on route channeling you to an alternative destination
through newark it is a busy place and if we keep you airside you will
just disappear from the system hopefully we can keep a security screen
to break your trail there i can't tell you where you are going at least
not in a letter but i plan to be on the flight to the us and we can
talk once we are out of uk airspace it is crucial that you do not bring
anything that can be tracked no phones no tablets nothing of that sort
we will set you up with everything you need when you get there

we intercepted the attached tempest executive report from the director
last night and i figure we can spend the flight cracking it i might as
well get started on your training asap i already transcribed it into
the adfgvx notation but have left the first few lines in musical
notation for you so you can see how the steganography looks in case
you come across it in the wild

i hope we can make this disappearing trick work but i have to be honest
it won't be easy be careful keep your eyes open and do not be tempted
to tell anyone else about it

good luck

harry
