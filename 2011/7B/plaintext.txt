Time is short so I must record my findings on the Tempest communication
system while I can. The Tempest conspiracy have in part moderated their
more murderous tendencies in recent years as far as I can tell because
they have found more profit in the exploitation of business intelligence.
With increased government surveillance of the international communications
networks including the postal and telegram services they have devised a
cunning system to disguise and encrypt messages in musical form. In truth
the encryption and the steganography are somewhat intermingled. The text
is encrypted using a standard ADFGVX cipher usually so far as I can tell
with the keywords for both the six by six polybius square and the
transposition step being taken from the musical dictionary. The disguise
is achieved by representing the letters ADFG as the corresponding musical
notes in the standard scale with V and X represented by a modifier sharp
and flat respectively applied to any note. So for example the musical
fragment C sharp F G flat D would denote the digraphs VF and XD. The fact
that the V and X can be represented in lots of different ways adds a little
to the security of the steganography but nothing to the security of the
cipher itself of course. With this simple device the Tempest Conspiracy have
been able to disseminate state secrets banking details and commercially
sensitive information across the world even during times of war.
