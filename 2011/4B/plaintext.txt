tempest agents

action at once further tracking of texts and emails in southern central
region confirms active investigation into tempest the turing papers have
been found and the operatives appear to be students at a location in the
vicinity of bletchley park tempest analysis of stored internet traffic
from the same sources suggests that they acted previously under the name
the night climbing club

surveillance and housekeeping teams in southern central to mount detailed
tempest tracking and to triangulate on traffic sources

london region to mount full tempest tracking of security and police
agencies and to report any apparent contact with the night climbing club
members

standing orders remain that no contact is to be made without direct
clearance from my office preparations should be made to eliminate the
threat but no action should be taken without central authorisation

it appears that the operators are young amateurs and given the lack of
sophistication in their security it may be difficult to discern how far
the tempest papers have leaked preventing a suitably quiet termination
of the threat
