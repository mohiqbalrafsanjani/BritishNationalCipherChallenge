i cracked another section of turings papers it was really tricky since
he used a keyword substitution cipher but then he reversed the order of
the letters in each fiveblock i had to reverse them all myself before i
could even start to crack it if i hadn't guessed it was double encrypted
i would never have got it and it was really long next one you get to do

anyway i think you are right tempest was the first hacking crew in history
and if turing never closed them down they could still be active and they
could be watching us i don't know what we should do who do you contact
about something like this can we just ring up gchq and report it and what
do we report that we stole a bunch of papers while trespassing on private
property and that they expose a two hundred year old conspiracy it doesn't
sound convincing does it but what if they are still active maybe they are
behind all these recent conflicts or the banking crisis or the problems
in greece this could be massive

i just had a thought did you meet anyone at that university summer school
you went to who might be able to help wasn't there a professor ben something
or another who was connected with codes could you ask him what we should do
