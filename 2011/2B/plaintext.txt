i have uncovered convincing and clear evidence that tempest were involved
in several more assassination attempts over the years following perceval's
death. a friend in the foreign and commonwealth office unearthed several
boxes of documents from the early period of victoriaï¿½s reign that seem to
be records of a top secret intelligence enquiry set up by palmerston to
investigate edward oxford's attempt on her life. oxford fired twice and
missed both times, but it is perhaps surprising that having been charged
with high treason he was treated rather leniently by the courts. he was
acquitted by reason of insanity and after some time in broadmoor was allowed
to leave for australia.

the material sent to me seems to be evidence from the palmerston enquiry
and it is labelled "thunderstorm", which cannot be a coincidence. it also
discusses lawrence's attempt on andrew jackson's life five years before
and that puzzled me since it was not apparent at first that there was any
connection with oxford. but lawrence too was found not guilty by reason
of insanity (though he spent the rest of his life in institutions) and the
clear parallels between the two incidents (two shots, both missed) are
suggestive. i suspect that if the material been made public there would
have been an outcry. fear of an international conspiracy, able to take
on the most protected in our societies, could have led to considerable
unrest, and i suspect that is the reason for the secrecy surrounding the
enquiry itself.

i had hoped to find other documents directly linked with tempest
communications, but certain files from the enquiry have been redacted
or removed and it is unlikely that we will find them now. i tried to
contact harry to see if he could shed more light on the jackson incident,
but my contacts tell me he is involved in the die alchemisten project so
i can't reach him. in the meantime i continue my research into
steganography to see if i can make sense of the tempest conspiracy's use
of musical notation.
