i have only a hazy recollection of the events of the next few months
the rain fell incessantly and the trenches and our boots filled with
water i spent many hours with fingers frozen as i took readings of
wind direction and force and experimented with nozzle designs for our
gas weapon

i was haunted by the memory of the dawn firing squad and by the suffering
of our troops following the german attack and i was seized by an urgency
that blocked all feeling of common humanity with the enemy the fabulists
had done their job well

it quickly became apparent to me that forecasting atmospheric conditions
would be of crucial importance in determining how and when to use the
weapon without unduly jeopardizing our own troops after several months
in the trenches taking measurements i returned to verona hq and began
work on a new statistical model of wind movements based on the work
of bayes

you had joined up and been sent to the front by this time and as i
laboured i began to hear tales of your heroism in battle i was ashamed
to be enjoying the comforts of the chateau but by then i was obsessed
with the belief that my work could end the war quickly and that i might
save you and hundreds of thousands of young men like you

finally beginning to make progress on the difficult task of analyzing
wind patterns i showed my work to valentine and proteus and to my
surprise they immediately reassigned me to another division i can see
now that the safe deployment of the weapon was a secondary concern for
them and they were preoccupied with the lethal power it would convey
i think they were disappointed that i had failed to engage in the design
of new poisons but i could never do that i still recalled my horror as i
listened to hahn in berlin describing the effects of mustard gas there
was something chilling in the contrast between the cold dispassion of a
scientific lecture and the vileness of the results he reported and i
could not bring myself to work in the laboratories

looking back i can see that the fabulists needed me out of the way in
order to carry out the next step of their plan however in reassigning
me the two gentlemen from verona had made a very bad mistake
