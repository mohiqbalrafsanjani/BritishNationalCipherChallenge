my dear charles,

i have decyphered the first section of my uncle's will and i am deeply
saddened and perplexed by it. i had hoped that it would explain the
sad circumstances of his death and allow me to remember him with the
affection i recall from my childhood. of course i knew that tiberius
had been engaged in secret government work prior to the war, but i had
refused to believe that he could have had anything to do with those foul
new weapons that so scarred my generation. i am not sure that i want to
read the rest of his letter to me. before i read it i could not have
accepted that he had collaborated with the enemy, but i had not realized
that he was acquainted with hahn, a fact i read with distaste, and his
claim to have maintained that relationship at the request of the government
is the worst sort of self-justification.

i am puzzled by tiberius's strange instruction that i should decypher the
document. it seems a trivializing, if not to say frivolous, request. it is
hard to square this with the suicide note of a traitor, but perhaps i have
been here on malta for too long. it is many years since i spent time in the
company of friends or relatives and, though i find the solitude consoling,
it makes me a poor judge of character.

i am sorry to say that i am ashamed of my uncle and i have decided not to
continue with this unpleasant game. i will have nothing more to do with him,
but i see no need to add to the embarrassment of his friends and family and
i would ask you to maintain the greatest discretion in your communications
concerning this disappointing document, as i have done in encrypting
this letter.

yours sincerely,

nicholas
