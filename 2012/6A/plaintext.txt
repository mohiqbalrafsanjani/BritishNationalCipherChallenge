dear nicholas

things are much clearer now and i realize the danger you are in
i was visited today by two gentlemen matching the description of
valentine and proteus they claimed to be acting for the government
and were asking if i knew where to find you they clearly were aware
that you had left malta but fortunately had not as far as i can
tell traced you here they were most insistent that they needed to
talk with you saying that the government was owed a substantial sum
from the estate of your uncle and that they wished to discuss terms
for repayment i have to say that i was impressed by their ingenuity
they might equally have claimed to be offering you a sum owed to
tiberius but the tale they spun carried just the right level of
threat to be almost convincing

i deciphered the latest chapter of your uncle's will with little
more difficulty than i had encountered with the previous section it
was very similar in spirit and indeed used the same tabula recta
though the encryption algorithm was slightly different i believe it
is known as the beaufort cipher

i recommend that you stay away from london for a little while until
we have considered what we must do to protect you i have contacts
who may be able to help

very best wishes
charles
