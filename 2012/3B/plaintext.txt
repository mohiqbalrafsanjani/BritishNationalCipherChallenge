the effect of the gas attack on morale was catastrophic and the
generals over-reacted terrified that the front-line positions
would break up they sent young officers to hold the line and
prosecuted deserters with ferocity i thought i had seen the worst
that war could offer in the hospitals treating the terrified
victims of the gas but the firing squads were worse and i was
sent by verona to witness one i realize now that their intention
was to frighten me my reports on the first gas attack made clear
my loathing for this new type of warfare and they needed to find
ways to pressure me to work on the development of our own weapon

the young subaltern had fled the trenches as the gas rolled along
them he had urged the others to run too and that added to his guilt
in the eyes of the court martial he was sent to the firing squad
and verona chose to use his death as a warning to me their plan
might have backfired if i had chosen to blame our generals for this
savage treatment of young and frightened men but instead in my anger
following the attack at ypres i chose to blame the enemy for this
death too and finally agreed to lead a team working on gas weapons

i can't forgive myself for what happened later and it is clear that
standing by the firing squad in the cold dawn i made the worst
decision of my life the young man stood alone and brave and he
reminded me of you we had stopped you from joining the army once
but soon you would be sixteen and we would not be able to prevent
you joining the regiment then i convinced myself that by hastening
the end to the war i would save many lives and i might save you

all sides in that terrible conflict were engaged in a desperate
search for a new weapon to break the deadly stalemate of trench
warfare but even if things had turned out differently it would be
still hard to say that i made the right decision that morning

i will understand if you can't forgive me but as you will later see
things were to become far more complicated and dangerous for us both
and i am sorry to say that the danger did not end with the war
