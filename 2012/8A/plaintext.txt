dear charles

this final cypher from tiberius was a devil it is somewhat related to
the adfgvx cypher and i will send you more information about it shortly

in the meantime allow me to summarise its contents the fabulists have
grown too powerful and both he and i are at mortal risk and must
disappear you can see immediately that his last message contained one
shocking revelation at least and once you have read the whole of the
document you will understand

i shall be leaving before first light to take up a new life as a new
man with a new purpose to destroy valentine and proteus and all that
they stand for i do not feel ready for this challenge but then i never
felt ready waiting for the command to leave the trenches either when
the whistle blows there is nothing left but to charge and pray and
that is what i will do now

please don't worry and please don't try to find me i will contact you
soon after the new year

it remains for me to thank you for all your support over these last
months and years as nicholas i have found your support and encouragement
invaluable in my new identity i have a feeling that it will be essential

sincerely yours
harry
