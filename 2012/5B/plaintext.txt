verona had decided to reassign me to a new code-breaking division in
london an outpost of room forty within the admiralty i was required
to report to commander denniston who trained me in the elements of
my new task and it quickly became apparent that the methods of
conditional probabilities developed by bayes in which i had become
adept during my work on wind forecasting could give us a crucial
advantage in the task of cryptanalysis

glad as i was to escape the horrors of chemical weapons i think now
that valentine and proteus had intended to cloister me in naval
intelligence in order to avoid any chance that i might uncover their
dreadful secret but the relationship between the admiralty code-breaking
division in room forty and the army division miib was closer than the
fabulists had imagined and the interaction between these agencies
together with my field experience on the continent meant that i was
increasingly engaged in the task of breaking battlefield and german
high-command communications encouraged by the engineers in our
increasingly sophisticated signals unit who were adept at intercepting
telegraphic messages from the far fields of europe i threw myself into
work once more until one wintery wednesday afternoon i received a
message that gripped and horrified me

new as this cipher was i did not have time to enjoy my triumph in
decrypting it as the plaintext revealed a criminal conspiracy at the
highest levels in british intelligence led by the fabulists even as
the full horror of my involvement in their scheme was laid out before
me i could not take it in reporting the conspiracy was impossible
since i could not be sure who was involved even if i could trust
someone outside of verona the security in our unit was so tight that
i had no chance to take any evidence with me i realized that i would
have to conceal my discovery while i undertook further research of my
own into the network of traitors within our intelligence services

unfortunately i was clumsy in my investigations and my carelessness
nearly cost you your life and your reputation a mistake for which i can
never forgive myself i can only pray that you will be able to forgive
me i received a telegram from verona summoning me back to ypres later
that month as i read it i knew that the fabulists had somehow become
aware of my interest in their secret work and i fully believed that i
was being sent to my death in the trenches

i boarded the boat to flanders and surrounded by weary soldiers
returning to the front line i turned my thoughts to finding a way
to expose the fabulists' plans
