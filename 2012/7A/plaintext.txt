dear charles

the story of my injury at last makes sense and i am ready to forgive
tiberius i knew that i had been unconscious for some time after the
gas attack but i had always assumed that i had spent that time in the
field hospital remembering nothing after leaving miss brittain

my own enquiries here in london have established that valentine and
proteus are high-ranking officials in whitehall with deep connections
across the foreign office moreover it is clear that they are aware of
my return to england and i suspect that i am being followed and that
my letters are being read i am increasingly sure that the only reason
i am still alive is that they are not certain who else might know
tiberius's story

it is critical that they do not discover the details and i am sure
that this is why tiberius encrypted the last sections of his will with
such care he must have learned about hill's new cypher when he visited
yale three years ago i am not at all sure i would have been able to
decypher this part of the will if he had used a matrix bigger then
two-by-two

i have to say that the most alarming revelation here is tiberius'
statement that he was not yet aware of the full depth of their
treachery given the horror of what they did to me and to my men i
find it hard to imagine much worse i fear that my life will never
be the same again

sincerely yours
nicholas
