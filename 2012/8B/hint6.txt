Dear Charles,

In case you are really stuck the transposition stage just reverses the order of the block so if block 1 reads ABCCB then after the transposition it reads BCCBA. I guess once you know this then it should be possible to crack the cipher using some frequency analysis!

PS, just noticed a typo in my previous message. It should have read:

the first and second characters are entangled, the second, 3rd, and fourth are entangled, the 4th,5th are entangled, the 6th 7th are entangled, the seventh 8th, 9th are entangled , the ninth and 10th are entangled and so on

 

Sorry, Harry
