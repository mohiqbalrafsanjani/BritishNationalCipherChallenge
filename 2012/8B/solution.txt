The cipher is partly a trifid cipher and partly a transposition cipher.
The cipher acts on blocks of five characters. First, the characters of
the block of plaintext are converted into triplets of 0,1,2 based on the
trifid cube and strung together. Then, the string of trinary digits
undergoes a transposition. The result is then reencoded as characters
to form a block of the ciphertext, in the same fashion as they were
converted from the plaintext.

Note that this is different from the trifid cipher that is published on
the internet. Those ciphers use a transposition that always takes every
fifth trinary digit, for blocks of five characters.

The cube is

    C Y P    U V W    G I J
    H E R    X Z A    K L M
    _ S T    B D F    N O Q

so that the keyword is CYPHER.

The transposition is (4,3,2,1,0,9,8,7,6,5,14,13,12,11,10), which is a
reversal of each set of five trinary digits.
