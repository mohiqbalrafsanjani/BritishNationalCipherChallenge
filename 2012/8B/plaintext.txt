The gas weapon developed by the Fabulists had one distinctive feature – the strange red marks that afflicted everyone affected by it. This was their undoing. I began to gather accounts of these marks appearing on the bodies of our own men, and it became apparent to me that Valentine and Proteus had sold the gas to our enemies. I labored for many years to gather evidence of their treachery, but they were skilled in deception and I was never able to establish their guilt beyond reasonable doubt. The Fabulists proved too valuable to the establishment and an uneasy truce settled between us. They were unsure how much I knew, and I was unsure what risk they posed to us both. While they could not be certain what proof I might have lodged with a third party they did not dare take action against me.
Now however they have grown strong, with influence at the top levels of government. I was warned that they had decided to take action against me and I was forced to fake my own death in order to escape them. That left you vulnerable, and so I have had to prepare for you to disappear as well. I have taken steps to establish a new identity and a new life for you, and Charles has all the resources you will need. What you do with this new start is up to you, but knowing you well I would urge you to join my friends in the intelligence services. They have need of people like you and we may have the opportunity to work together.
I am afraid that I have had to choose a new name for you in order to prepare the documents you will need, I hope you don’t mind. I have taken the opportunity to honour the courage of the young man, Harry, whose execution I witnessed during the war. He was no coward and it seems fitting for his name to live on. With fondest regards,

Tiberius.
