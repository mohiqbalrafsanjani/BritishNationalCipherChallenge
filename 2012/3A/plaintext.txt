my dear charles,

at your urging i am continuing to decypher my uncle's will. his
statement that "the danger did not end with the war" is somewhat
alarming. was it his intention to suggest that i am at some risk?
could his actions during the war really be posing a danger to me
after all this time? it is clear that we will have to complete the
decryption if we are to understand.

i did not encounter verona during the war, and have heard nothing
about it during my exile here on malta, but i think it might be
time to make discrete enquiries about it in london. would you oblige
me in this?

one other thing. almost certainly i am jumping at shadows, but my
landlady remarked that over the last week or so she has noticed
two men loitering in the neighbourhood of my apartment. i cannot
believe that this is connected with my uncle's will, but his warning
has alarmed me and i have engaged the assistance of a local detective
to keep watch.

i take your point about securing our communications. tiberius is
clearly more concerned to secure these later sections of the document
as well, and i had to work hard to break the keyword cypher he used
here. returning to the wartime convention of five letter blocks really
does add to the security of the text, and i had to carry out frequency
analysis on this section of the will. i suggest that in the future we
too use the wartime convention. i think that with this precaution the
affine shift cypher should afford us sufficient security in our letters
to one another.

yours,
nicholas
