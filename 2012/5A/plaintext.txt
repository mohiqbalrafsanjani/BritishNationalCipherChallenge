dear charles

much is now apparent to me my uncle's work for british intelligence
explains the gaps in his history and if indeed tiberius found himself
caught up in a conspiracy beyond his power to control then perhaps his
death was not that of a coward but just possibly the result of foul play

tiberius implies that the fabulists were involved in my injury and if
he is correct then for the first time since my evacuation from the
battlefield i have a new enemy to find and to fight i swore during the
long weeks of my treatment in the field hospital at etaples that i
would never bear arms again my nurse miss brittain urged me to take
courage but all bravery was gone dissolved by the burning pain of the
corrosive gas now i feel a new fire the anger stirred in me by uncle
tiberius's account reigniting my old fighting spirit and i have decided
to take on the investigation of the fabulists myself

you say that my enemies may still be active in london so i will embark
on the next steamer to the city could i ask you to please arrange
accommodation for me i will telegraph my travel plans

by the way the cypher used by tiberius in this text was devilishly
difficult to decrypt but since we now know that he was trained in
cryptology we might expect future chapters to be increasingly hard
to decypher i conducted my own research and discovered that this
type was first broken by charles babbage to save you time i will tell
you that the key has length three

yours sincerely
nicholas
