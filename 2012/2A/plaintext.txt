my dear nicholas

i know how shocking these revelations must have been for you, and
given your past experiences no one could blame you for the decision
you have made to turn your back on your uncle's strange request.
nonetheless, while we are still unsure of the purpose of the
document i think it would be a mistake to relinquish the task
he has set you.

i must admit that i find it almost impossible to reconcile your
current view of tiberius with the man we both knew, and so i have
taken the liberty of deciphering the next chapter of his will myself,
in the hope of revealing more information that might help us to
understand him better. i know that its contents will not entirely
reassure you, but i think you owe it to yourself, if not to tiberius,
to read on.

in the meantime allow me to share some remarks concerning the will.
throughout my professional life, i have had the misfortune to read a
number of final letters written by men driven to self destruction and
i must tell you that this has an entirely different feel to it. there
is a frankness which suggests that tiberius is more concerned for the
truth to be known than he is to protect his reputation. i have a feeling
that tiberius understood that this would be hard for you, but whether
you like it or not i am certain that you will learn the truth if you
complete the challenge he has left you.

you said that we should maintain the greatest discretion, but i am
sure tiberius would remind you that a caesar shift cypher could not
possibly provide you with the degree of security you require. i suggest
that you might follow tiberius's lead and use something more secure like
an affine shift cypher for your reply.

yours,
charles
