My Dear Letzter,

I have good news. The agent Kholi has been captured and is now being held
at the hydro plant in Uttar Pradesh alongside the American physicist Salinen.
For now Salinen is refusing to cooperate, and he has shown a tiresome degree
of courage. We are hoping however that a recent development may come to our
aid. The agent known as Charlie has arrived in Bombay and our agents are
following her movements. She appears to be making plans to travel to
Shiraz-i-Hind, and if we capture her there we may be able to use her to persuade
Salinen to work with us. Few of our enemies have the moral courage to watch
someone else suffering for them.

Our physicists tell me that their initial calculations suggest that the
device should indeed be capable of producing sufficient energies for our
purpose. With Salinens assistance we are on the brink of a new dawn. We
alone will have the ability to control the power of the sun here on earth.
The Reich will be avenged.
