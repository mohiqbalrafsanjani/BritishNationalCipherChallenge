my dear friend herz-feuer,

all is well here. both of our agents made it safely onto british soil. the chaos
on the island in the thames made it easy to smuggle two more men unnoticed onto
one of the many rescue boats crossing the estuary. the liberation of the
mountain should proceed as planned.

the location of the twin is yet to be determined but our agents are
currently recruiting local sympathizers to assist in tracking it down, and to
help find a suitable headquarters for our scientists to work.

once their mission is accomplished our spies in england should be instructed to
cross country to cornwall for their extraction. do not reply until you are able
to confirm their whereabouts.

for the honour of the reich,
tag letzter
