Harry,

I took your advice and packed the kids off to Aunt Aggies for a while.
I figure there isnt a Nazi agent alive that can take her on and live to tell
the tale. I made my excuses in London and am working out of a small office by
the docks in Southampton one of the few left standing after the Blitz. I
have a pilot friend who works the flying boats from here. He owes me a favour
and I suspect we may need to move fast. By the way it turns out he knows Gordon
Mitchell they worked together in search and rescue for a while. Thought the
connection might suggest a few ideas to you for cipher keys!

The latest Nazi message we intercepted was a bit of a pig to crack in more ways
than one, though once I figured out that it was just a keyword substitution it
fell pretty quickly. Surprising to find that the Nazi agents seem to be
Wodehouse fans!

In all seriousness I am beginning to fear for Kholis safety; the Nazis are
ruthlessly exploiting the cults loyalty to the diamond and this will, I am
sure, make it difficult for him to recruit any cult members as agents. Have you
heard any more from any of our contacts? We really do need to try to figure out
what the Nazis have in mind. Should I hitch a ride on that flying boat and tail
Herz-Feuer maybe?

Aunt Aggie says Hi.

Charlie
