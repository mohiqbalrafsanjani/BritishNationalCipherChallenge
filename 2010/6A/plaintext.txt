Harry,

I followed Kholi to the Nazi HQ in Uttar Pradesh. It seems that he has
friends on the inside and he has been able to get messages out to me.
The attached report was taken from the desk of the Commandant at the
facility and tells us at last what is going on. The last sentence is
almost flattering! Good to know we are getting to them.

By the way, the encryption fooled me for a while. Figured it must be
another transposition cipher and it is, but boy is it cunning. Whoever
designed it took the name a bit literally I think. Anyway, the key is to
figure out the shape. The spacing is very confusing, but get rid of
that and count the characters. What do you notice? I'll leave the rest
to you.

Could you follow up on this report with your contacts in the States?
Maybe the guys mentioned (Townes, Gordon and Zeiger) could tell us how
likely it is that the Nazis can actually build this device.

In the meantime I am making plans for an assault on the labs. We have
two objectives, of course. We need to stop the Nazis, but we also need
to rescue Kholi and his friends. I figure having him on the inside is
a big plus. If we can coordinate things right I have an idea to destroy
the entire base, but I will need quite a large supply of RDX. Not the
sort of thing you can walk into a hardware store and ask for without
raising a few questions. Do you have a source for that here?

Let me know when you arrive and I will arrange transport and accommodation
near the power station. I suggest replying with a Vigenere cipher and
keyword of length two.

Charlie
