Report from Indian intelligence concerning
overseas operatives in Uttar Pradesh

Sources in Uttar Pradesh reporting heightened activity among
foreign nationals. Suspected Nazi infiltration of regional
power generation network and suspicious activity at the
hydro-electric plant. UK and American Embassy traffic increased
shortly after the arrival of suspected agents known as Charlie
and Harry and we placed them both under round-the-clock
surveillance. We have reason to believe they intend to disrupt
the Nazi operation. Our agents arranged to supply Harry with
a large quantity of RDX explosives and the shipment is being
closely monitored by Indian Special Forces. The RDX is not
fitted with detonators, so is largely inert.

The American physicist Trevor Salinen, who disappeared recently,
is believed to be being held by the cult of the Koh-I-Noor, for
reasons currently unknown to us. Special Forces are standing by
to effect a rescue once this has been confirmed.

We are monitoring the traffic between C and H in the hope of
clarifying the situation at the power plant.
