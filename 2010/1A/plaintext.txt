harry the report below is causing a lot of concern in uk intelligence and
government circles. whitehall asked me to bring you in on this. can you get over
by next week? seems like your sort of problem. hope you can make it, this is
turning into something big. anyway here is the intelligence report from our
agents.

we have been getting reports of enemy activity along essex coast under cover of
last weeks flooding. one reported sighting of a submarine close inshore on
essex marshes.

several nazi sympathisers in east anglia known to have slipped surveillance
during the confusion with some possible sightings later in london.

indian intelligence reporting considerable activity in bombay among ex-pat
fascists with links to the uk nazi movement, in particular to one of the agents
now missing.

by the way, we intercepted the attached message, which shouldnt pose too much
of a challenge to decrypt! charlie
