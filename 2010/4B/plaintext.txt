My Dear Herz-Feuer,

Your work with the cult is of the first order, and our hopes now rest
entirely on finding a suitable power source for the device. Our agents
have infiltrated the Power Wing of the Central Water and Power Commission
and have begun a systematic and comprehensive study of the hydro-electric
resources in the country. Their initial estimates suggest the potential
to generate over four thousand megawatts at peak load, assuming only sixty
percent efficiency. German engineering may well increase this and I see a
happy future for the Reich in the Indian subcontinent. Even now a pilot
power plant in Uttar Pradesh is generating enough power for our initial
trials with the Taschenlampe project.

The enemy agent known to us as Kholi has been getting close to our
operations and it may be time to bring him in. I will arrange for him
to be held at the power plant until we can interrogate him further.

Your friend,
Tag Letzter
