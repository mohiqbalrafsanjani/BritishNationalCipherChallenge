Charlie,

Not best pleased to hear you are now working on the inside at the power
plant how did Kholi arrange that from a cell? Anyway having you both there
is a big plus from the point of view of this operation and I guess I can live
with it. You really do seem to have inherited more than your share of Aunt
Aggies spirit.

I found a supplier for the RDX working on the fringes of the Indian military and
he has arranged for a truck load to be delivered to the power plant in the guise
of industrial lubricants no-one is going to stick their hand in a barrel of
oil to check it and he claims they can wrap the RDX in something to protect it.
I am not sure what you have in mind he tells me the amount you have asked
for could bring down a small mountain, but better safe than sorry.

My contacts in the US tell me the physicists mentioned in the Nazi report have
all been working on some sort of ray beam like in the movies. I have no idea if
this can be turned into a serious weapon, but whether or not it can I am not
happy to see an organisation like this one get any traction, so I say we should
aim to wipe it out in one blow. I am hoping thats what you have in mind too.

My main worry is how we get you, Kholi and Salinen out of there safely. Does
Kholi have anyone else he needs to protect?

I like this Vigenere system, but maybe a keyword of length seven would be
better next time?

All the best,
Harry
