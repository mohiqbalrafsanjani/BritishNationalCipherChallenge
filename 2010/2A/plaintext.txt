Charlie,

The theft of the Imperial Crown from the White Tower last week has shocked the
intelligence community and most of my contacts are lying low, but I made some
enquiries with Kholi. I think you met him when we were both in Lahore during the
war? He has heard rumours that the ancient cult of the Koh I Noor twins has been
very active recently and it cant be a coincidence that the crown held the Koh
I Noor diamond.

I cant believe how nave the German agents are being, if they keep using
these easily cracked ciphers we will be find it pretty easy to keep tabs on
them. This one is a bit tougher but no one is going to lose much sleep over an
affine shift! Anyway it says that the Nazis really are behind the theft of the
diamond, though I still have no clear idea why!

I am concerned that they know about our involvement watch your back, your
Aunt will never forgive me if anything happens to you. I would suggest sending
the kids to the country for a while (though Cornwall might not be the best
choice) so you can disappear if you have to.

Kholi has infiltrated the cult and will be feeding us more intelligence soon; I
will let you know if I hear anything. Harry
