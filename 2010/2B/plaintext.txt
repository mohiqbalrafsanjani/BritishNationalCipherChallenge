My Dear Letzter,

The diamond is safe in our hands and on its way to the rendezvous. It will be
flown from there to our agents in Slovenia who will arrange for it to be shipped
to Bombay. The cult is, as you can imagine, in a high state of excitement, but
they have no idea of our plans for the gem.

The main task of our agents in India is to obtain the Koh I Noor twin. With both
jewels in our possession the cult members will be ours to command and the work
of our physicists can begin in earnest.

There is one serious cause for concern. We have heard rumours that the agent
known as Harry has been making extensive enquiries in the region. We had hoped
that the Americans would be kept out of this operation, since they have no real
strategic interests in this part of the world, however the British agent
Charlie, who we believe to be related to our old nemesis Agatha Highfield, is
thought to have brought US intelligence into the field. We may need to take care
of that particular irritation.

For the honour of the Reich,
Herz-Feuer
