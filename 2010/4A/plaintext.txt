I was going to tell you not to go, but I hear from Gordon that you have already
gone. He said that you mentioned something about a German buying a ticket on a
Short Solent, and before he had finished speaking you were out in the harbour
booking passage for the Canaries. I am guessing from the intel. in the attached
that you will end up in Bombay so I am sending a copy of this to the Canaries
and one to the US Naval Attache in Bombay.

I got a pretty frantic telegram from Kholi, he has got close to certain members
of the head of the cult and is in contact with the Nazi sympathisers. So far he
knows that the Nazis are building an advanced technological device which will
use the two diamonds, but no-one seems to know what it does. Im more than a
little worried about this new technology, as its beginning to sound to me
like something I saw in blueprints back in the US, and it looked far too
powerful to be just a new type of flashlight.

I was heading out to India myself in a few days, Kholi needs someone to watch
his back though it appears from the message we intercepted below that we may
be too late. I have other agents combing Uttar Pradesh but no news yet.
Whatever happens, stay safe.

By the way,the attached German cipher was extra hard to crack, in more ways
than one. It took me a while to figure it out but then I remembered something
I discussed with Jack Wolfe, a Professor from Brooklyn. The Nazis used to pad
a lot of their messages with the letter X to hide the frequencies. They got
sloppy after a while and used them pretty systematically before and after all
numbers, proper names, place names, sentences, within abbreviations. Once I
figured out that was there it was pretty easy to strip it out and crack the
cipher.

Good luck, Charlie. Be careful.
