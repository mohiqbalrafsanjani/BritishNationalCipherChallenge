Thank you for your message however I will reassure you that my confidence in our
situation is not misplaced at all. Please consider the fact that I am may just
not be revealing my entire battle at this time, the opinion of this field agent
is of great importance for reasons which I will not reveal incase this message
is intercepted.
After my last advance, Rose seems to have disappeared. I am hoping that she
will return soon but I feel trying to persuade her to do training may in fact be
the wrong approach and we should try something more subtle. Your information of
her gift is very interesting as so far any advice she has given has been
flawless, maybe we should consider a different position for her. If you are
right then it is vitally important that she is protected and we must double our
efforts in trying to find her.
I also have also just heard news that our enemy is now investing heavily in
cryptanalysis so I recommend from here on the use varied and strong cyphers. You
would be well advised to consider sharing the es amongst other letters as I have
done here to distort the frequency or using a poly alphabetic cypher to the same
effect but even this may not prove enough depending. I have instructed my spies
to keep me well informed on any developments and to make it one of their main
priorities as secure communication is critical in this stage of the war.
