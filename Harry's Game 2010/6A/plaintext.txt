I HAVE NOT SLEPT. IT IS NOW THE MORNING AFTER AN INTERMINABLE NIGHT AS I LAY
WAITING FOR THE INEVITABLE START OF THE HOSTILITIES. IT IS STILL EARLY. LOOKING
OUT OF MY WINDOW, IT WOULD NOT BE POSSIBLE TO DISCERN THIS MORNING WAS ANY
DIFFERENT TO ANY OTHER. IT IS ONLY OUR MAN MADE CONFLICT THAT WILL CHANGE
EVERYTHING. SO I AM TO REPORT EARLY TO HARRY WHO WILL, NO DOUBT, HAVE MY FATE
PLOTTED OUT. I DON'T WANT TO DO IT BUT I KNOW HARRY'S FORCEFUL CHARACTER WILL
LEAVE ME WITH NO CHOICE. THE EVERLASTING CARCOPHONY OF
WAR INTRUDED INTO MY THOUGHTS, BRINGING MY INEVITABLE FATE CLOSER. MY BAGS WERE
LYING EMPTY ON MY BED. I WANTED TO BRING UP THE COURAGE TO PACK THEM BUT I JUST
COULD NOT. I HAVE TO. AS CRAZY AS IT SOUNDS I'M THINKING ABOUT WHERE I'LL BE
STATIONED. WILL IT BE HOT OR COLD; SURELY THIS WILL MEAN I NEED TO PACK
DIFFERENT THINGS. I'M MAKING IT FEEL LIKE IT'S A HOLIDAY. A KNOCK ON THE DOOR
SIGNIFIES THAT MY TAXI HAS ARRIVED TO TAKE ME TO WHATEVER QUEST IS MY DESTINY.
ONWARDS.
