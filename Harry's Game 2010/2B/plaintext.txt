I fear that our communication lines are being watched and have taken the extra
precaution of writing this letter backwards, in case the enemy cryptanalysis is
better than they let on.
From a correspondent within the enemyâ€™s ranks (who will remain nameless in case
this message is intercepted) the general feel is one of victory. They appear to
vastly underestimate our strength, which is good, they will be more relaxed,
they will make mistakes. We need to guess where these mistakes will lie and
exploit them. My correspondent also implies that their cryptography is
second-rate, however we must also consider the possibility that he is a clever
ruse to weaken our guards, to extract information. I am therefore not giving my
correspondent more information than is necessary until he can be proved
trustworthy.
At your suggestion this is encrypted with a simple cipher. If there is wind of
cryptanalysis from the enemy, a securer cipher must be used, perhaps some kind
of matrix or multiple key cipher. Messages hidden in the keys will prevent them
being deduced from the body of the plaintext, if anything is intercepted.
