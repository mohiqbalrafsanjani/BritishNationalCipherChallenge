Harry, I apologise for underestimating you. But I am afraid that you killed the
wrong woman. Rose is currently incognito, and we have it from good resources
that she is coming after you. After all our best efforts, you are still in
danger. All I will advise is that you, and everyone with you destroy your
equipment, and flee north. Run as far and as fast as you can, but knowing you,
you will make the others leave and wait for Rose. You can't take her on, she's
too strong. I do not need another man's life on my conscience. Really, you must
trust me... I know, you can't trust anyone, but trust this; You will never hear
from me or anyone else in this office. I promise not to endanger any more of
you. You must understand that I am truly sorry. Yours until the day I die, K.H.
