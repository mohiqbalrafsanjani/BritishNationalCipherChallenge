The key is the first three letters of the plaintext: "HAR".

Each character of the ciphertext is the sum of four plaintext letters, modulo 27,
where the alphabet is ".ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ" = 0, ..., 26. The sum is of
the current plaintext letter and three preceeding letters.

To decrypt, start with "HAR" and add each letter that you get by subtracting the
preceeding three plaintext letters from the current ciphertext letter.
