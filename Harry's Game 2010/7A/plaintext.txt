Twenty first of April

I am no traitor, but a fool. The information I passed to Harry with respect to
the planned movements of the enemy appears to have been false. Our defence is
centred on having an advantageous position from which to catch them unawares.
However, the great armies of the enemy have not turned north into the valley as
we had been led to believe. This defence is therefore useless, and the security
of our land is now far from certain.

It appears that the agent I enlisted to help me gain intelligence from the
heart of the enemys camp has double crossed me. Furthermore, it looks as if I
am the culprit. My allegiances have been far from clear, and Harry has been
suspicious of me since my last attempt to flee. But I would not deliberately put
the safety of my homeland at stake. I may be the weak link, having sought the
help of such an agent, but nothing more.

I fear for many. For myself, since I will surely be accused a traitor unless I
can, myself, glean enough to win us the war. A traitors punishment is severe
indeed, but I fear more for the fate of my people. At the end of this war I
shall disappear as I did once before. My ally is still loyal and would protect
me. But they will have to live with my mistake unless I can put a stop to the
storm.
