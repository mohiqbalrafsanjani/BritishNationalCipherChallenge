Undiscoverably, I left the lookout post when the marching started, and passed
the message to headquarters, intending to leave now my job is done but Harry has
found me. He says they need my help in the war that is coming. I told him what I
had heard, the thunder from a thousand miles away. I do not intend to stay with
him, though, because he intends to train me, use me for his own ends. I agreed
to keep a lookout for the soldiers because it was my duty, but now I am being
given no choice. Besides, he is a brutal man and already has the blood of one of
my friends on his hands. I hope he remembers.
Fear is rife amongst the soldiers. They are trained for combat, many have
fought in other wars, but the thunder and the beat of the foreign drums marches
through their heads in their dreams. Many cannot sleep.
I did at least meet an old friend on the road. We could not talk long but I
know he will stand by my side through all this.
