Harry, I fear that perhaps we have made some of our messages too easy for the
others to crack, so as an extra precaution, I am writing this in secret, and
delivering it to you personally, as well as encoding it with three different
keys. The first is based on the QWERTY keyboard. The second uses the alphabet
backwards. The third has the keyword ROSE. We cannot stop the war, and you
should begin to expect the worst. I have instructed Rose to keep a low profile,
and not to make a spectacle of herself, as this could result in her loyalties
changing. There is a storm on the way, with heavy thunder, so try to avoid using
telegraph signals and phone calls, as the weather may cause the lines to be
knocked out.
