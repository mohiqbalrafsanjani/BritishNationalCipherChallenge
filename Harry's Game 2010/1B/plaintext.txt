Harry, diplomacy has failed and war is inevitable. We have moved the frontier
people back to the mountains leaving a few small reconnaissance groups to watch
the border. It is up to you now. We need intelligence about the advance if we
are to have any chance of stopping it. We would like you to take charge of the
frontier; you need to organise the scouts, to direct their efforts and to report
their findings back to us. Communications are secure for the moment, but as the
advance guard encroach we will need to enhance the security. Use ciphers as you
see fit, we should be able to crack them. We are looking for a way to discourage
the invaders, so anything you can tell us about their morale or their
organisation will be of value. There is one agent in particular that we think
you will value. Her name is Rose and she is very gifted. She has an uncanny
knack of almost disappearing - melting into the background, blending with the
shadows until she is almost invisible. She also has a phenomenal memory and a
gift for languages, though her courage has not been tested, she has a temper and
she will need training. We have left her at the lookout post nearest the border
with instructions to warn us at the first sign of invasion. You should meet her
there and begin her training.
