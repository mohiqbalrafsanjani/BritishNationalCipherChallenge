War is imminent now but I am yet to discover what my true role in all this is to
be. My journey here has led me through strange and unfamiliar territory and I
find myself wondering how I got involved in such questionable affairs. I am
obviously useful to Harry and his entourage, but am unsure what is in store for
me; also what will happen if I do not cooperate. I must try to make him believe
I have submitted into going along with their plans and commence my training
schedule.
Since once again discovering my whereabouts, he is keeping a very close guard
on me; so keeping in touch with my old friend and ally is imperative to my
escape plans. Meanwhile, I will work on trying to find out their strategies by
intercepting communications and enlisting some help of an agent I am in touch
with who is usually very successful in message decryption.
My only hope is that I may be spared the horrors that my trusted friend faced
when he dared to oppose their schemes.
