I was out on the hill when it came. I was listening for it, expecting it,
hoping, I guess, not to hear it. A rolling thunder from a thousand miles away,
like muted surf on a beach. I needed the noise, confirmation that the others
hadn't all gone away for nothing, that there was a point to all this. I was
supposed to turn around and run, tell the rear guard, but for a moment I was
frozen to the spot as the sound gathered force. Like a fire spreading through a
valley, dark clouds tumbling over the hills, unstoppable, bringing the storm. A
million footfalls locked in step. Bringing the war. I felt the hate beginning to
burn behind my eyes. I melted into the shadows, turned and ran.
