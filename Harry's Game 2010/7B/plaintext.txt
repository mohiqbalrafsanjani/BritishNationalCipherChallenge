Harry,

What in God's name have you done? As ordered, the third and fourth regiments
were despatched to the northern pass, leaving us with but fourscore men to
defend the artillery emplacements holding the southern border. These selfsame
emplacements are now either smouldering wrecks or have fallen into the enemy's
filthy hands.

I am writing to you from our hideout, whose location I shall not reveal for
fear of interception. Suffice it to say, the ruins of the artillery are still in
our sight, as are the thousands of soldiers swarming along the banks of the
river. We shall endeavour to harry them, but our numbers are few, many are
wounded, and their scouting parties will no doubt soon bring our little fight to
an end.

When their vanguard approached under cover of darkness, they almost reached the
walls through want of sentries, and many of our men were cut down before they
could reach their rifles. It was all I could do to save the dozen men I have,
and hundreds of civilians, most of them evacuated from the north on your orders,
were butchered on that night.

Your so-called intelligence has led to this catastrophe, and I have only this
to say of your Rose: terminate her with utmost haste.
May God have mercy upon your soul,

K.H.
