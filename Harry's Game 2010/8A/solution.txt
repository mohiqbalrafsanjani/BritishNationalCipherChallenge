It is a Bacon 5-bit cipher. The ostensible ciphertext is
from Thomas Paine's "Crisis" (we must remove a word "by"
in order for it to line up correctly). When a letter in
the ciphertext matches Paine's text, write an "a". When
it differs (it is the next letter in the alphabet), write
a "b". Then decode using 5-bit numbers for letters:

    aaaaa = A
    aaaab = B
    aaaba = C
    aaabb = D
    ...
    bbaab = Z
