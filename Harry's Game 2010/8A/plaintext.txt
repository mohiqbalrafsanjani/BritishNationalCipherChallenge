These are the times that will be remembered.

The information I have passed to Harry should be the salvation
of our land if it is used correctly. It must silence the thunder,
my ally gave her life to obtain it.

Perhaps I will not be remembered as a traitor.

I cannot take the risk that it will also guarantee my salvation,
I will vanish like a spectre and live my life quietly now that
the storm has passed and spring has arrived in my beloved country.

Rose
