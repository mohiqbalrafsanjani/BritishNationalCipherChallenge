The thunder is deafening, the hour has arrived, war is upon us.
I am very concerned about Rose. Her talents are obvious but she
clearly doubts our intentions and her motivations are still
obscure to me. I do not believe that she realises how important
her skills are to the safety of our land in these desperate times.

The information in the final section of this message is of the
utmost secrecy and so it is encrypted with a running key cipher,
which is virtually impossible to crack without the key text. The
text that I have used is the poem that you know is close to my
heart because its message is so sweet and right.

We cannot take our eyes off the distant horizon as more and
more men come swarming over the hills. Our forward scouts
cannot see the full extent of the approaching army but they
estimate a force of between twenty thousand and thirty thousand
men. There is one ray of hope. Rose has given us vital
information but she will not say how she obtained it. Does she
have allies amongst the enemy or is it her intuition? It is hard
to trust her when her sources are so hidden. She says that the
army will turn north as they cross the border and march through
the valley. If that is true then our defence plans have a chance.

Harry.
