THE THUNDER WAS HEARD AGAIN LAST NIGHT LOUDER AND CLOSER THIS TIME,
BRINGING THE WAR CLOSER WITH IT. THE SOLDIERS HEARD IT TOO AND IT IS
CLEAR THAT THEY ARE UNEASY; NONE OF THEM HAVE FACED ENEMIES LIKE THESE
BEFORE AND DO NOT KNOW HOW TO PREPARE. I AM STILL AT THE LOOKOUT AND
AM STILL BEING FORCED TO STAY. HARRY APPROACHED ME AGAIN EARLIER, HE
WANTED TO TRY TO TEACH ME HOW TO FIGHT. I DECLINED AS POLITELY AS I
COULD AND, IN THE WAY I DO, DISAPEARED. HE WILL NOT FIND ME FOR A
WHILE YET, I HOPE, AS HE WILL WANT TO KNOW WHY I WILL NOT LEARN FROM
HIM AND I WILL HAVE TO EXPLAIN. BESIDES I HAVE NO DESIRE TO LEARN THE
SKILLS HE WANTS TO TEACH ME. I DO NOT THINK I WANT TO BE INVOLVED IN
THIS WAR ANY LONGER.
