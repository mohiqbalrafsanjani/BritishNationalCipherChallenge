Harry,
Your confidence in our position is admirable; however, the opinion of a field
agent is surely worth far less than that of the general in charge of this arm of
the war. It is vitally important that you take no rash actions; the enemy is
almost certainly going to succeed in an invasion if that is their aim. Your
actions must be very secret; our only hope lies in a powerful, omnipresent but
invisible network of spies and scouts, delivering every enemy communication to
us at HQ, and hampering their movements in small details at every turn. Please
confirm receipt of Agent Thunder; she needs to be absorbed into your group and
trained as quickly as possible, or else she may be captured (or worse, turn to
the enemy; she is somewhat fickle in her loyalties).
Rose will be very useful to you, but we need you to update us constantly on her
training. We feel it advisable to warn you that she may complain frequently of
the oncoming storm; while she is exceptionally talented with languages and
her memory, she often behaves as a mystical prophetess; perhaps she even does
have this predictive sense she complains of. This may be worth investigating.
