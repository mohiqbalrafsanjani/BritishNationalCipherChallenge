to my dearly beloved wife

my dear mary

at last i am free to write to you of our recent adventures here on the
border my work as postmaster general has consumed much of my life in the
last few months and the work occasioned by the introduction of a grand
chiffre by the french has occupied that which is left of me

for many days now the perils faced by our brave troops as they approached
the monstrous fort at badajoz gave me and many of my fellow officers cause
for deep concern and drove me to redouble my efforts to break this new
cipher the actions of the spanish collaborator from within the fort who
turned to our side all unknown to phillipon were of inestimable worth
in providing me with many letters written in that new and deeply
mysterious code many more were provided by the actions of our brave
guerilla friends among the portuguese peasants without their daring and
ruthless efforts my own ambitions would most certainly have been thwarted

it appears that all the devices known to the grandmaster maret have been
used to startling effect in this cipher salutations and signatures are
disguised to great effect and the frequency of letters and letter pairs
is most cunningly distorted if it were not for the careless use of a
small part of this cipher when it was first introduced i am sure that
no easy path to its determination would have been presented fortunately
maret's cunning is matched only by the lack of sophistication of governor
phillipon and by his own hand he wrought a great betrayal on his army but
then i am being unfair he was under great pressure when he encrypted his
penultimate message facing the imminent loss of the fort and perhaps he
was not fully aware of the proper use of such a magnificent cipher

in any case my love my work here is done at least for a little while
this battle is won others will be fought but i have no doubt that we
will prevail and the french will be driven from the peninsula it is my
hope we shall soon walk together along the beautiful boulevards of lisbon

your loving husband george
