lieut general viscount wellington kb to the earl of liverpool

my lord

i write to inform you of our preparation for the final assault on the
fort at badajoz held by the inclement weather and unable to cross the
guadiana once the pontoon had been cut we were forced to address the
threat posed by the outlying fort at picurina we continued to bombard
the walls until a sudden break in the weather enabled us to mount an
infantry attack in this we were encouraged by the intelligence provided
by a double agent who had approached us bearing letters from phillipon
to soult raising the alarm not wishing to alert soult to the fact that
we had intercepted this message we allowed the messenger to pass after a
suitable delay and with sufficient incentive to continue working for us

the initial attack came close to catastrophe repulsed as it was by the
deep ditch and the palisades captain oates of the eighty-eighth rescued
the attempt by ordering scaling ladders to be laid over the ditch to
provide a platform from which to climb the walls and the attack succeeded
despite the near loss of captain hardinge who had volunteered to join
kempf's brigade

with picurina under our control the batteries have been set up within
four hundred yards of the casements at the southeast corner of the fort
at badajoz and all our efforts will be directed to its capture at the
earliest opportunity

i have the honour to be etc wellington
