my dear scovell,

following the most regrettable escape of general soult's army through the hills to the north it
is the announced intention of lieutentant general sir arthur wellesley to raise a corps of
mounted guides, staffed by local sympathizers and led by our own officers. i have to desire that you
will be pleased to assume the command of this force, and to carry into effect such instructions as you
may receive. you will be assisted in this task by four lieutentants and four cornets as commissioned
officers, and promoted to assistant quartermaster general, a most richly deserved promotion. it is
also my intention to make my strongest recommendation that you should be promoted to major, though
as you are aware the power of appointing to commissions is not vested in me.

you and your staff are directed to keep a journal, or other memorandum, descriptive of the
movements of the enemy troops, and occurrences in which they are engaged; as also, you should take
and collect plans of the roads, rivers, bridges, settlements, positions, or fortified places, in which
the troops may be.

i do have one other more delicate assignment for you, which may excite your interest. the
french use of field ciphers is frustrating our success in intercepting their communications. i
would be most grateful if you would turn your particular attention to the attached memorandum which i
hope may give us some indication of their intentions, should it yield to your forensic scrutiny.

yours etc murray.
