major george scovell to commissary general murray.

my dear sir,

the art of writing in cypher is so much improved since conradus wrote as to render it next to impossible to
unravel what it conceals without being in possession of the key. the enclosed message resisted my analysis
for some time, until the fortuitous capture, by don julian and his brave guerillas, of some other
messages using the same cypher, several showing passages en clair. this gave me sufficient context to
begin the arduous task of breaking it.

several things become clear. first, that general marmont has persuaded his commanders and his king of
the vital importance of security in their communications. the variant on the dalmatian cypher used in the
attached communique is a clever ruse - simple enough to be reliably used on the field of battle, but
sufficiently ingenious to foil the amateur cypher clerk in his task. second, that the long awaited grand
chiffre has still not arrived at the court of king joseph, though its arrival will surely not be delayed
much longer. third - and this is most important - king joseph feels threatened by the independence of the
marshals in spain. his demand that he should retain direct authority over them signals a fractious
enemy, and this must surely please general wellington. should king joseph's wish be granted, the number of
messages between the forces in the field and king joseph's headquarters will necessarily dramatically
increase. this may indeed give us the advantage we seek in breaking their cyphers, however strong they
may be.

i remain etc., major scovell
