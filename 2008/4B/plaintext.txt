TO KING JOSEPH FROM THE HAND OF GENERAL MARMONT, DUKE OF RAGUSA
MY LORD,

OUR RECENT ENCOUNTERS WITH WELLINGTON AND HIS ARMIES HAVE BEEN LESS THAN THE
GLORIOUS SUCCESS THAT OUR BRAVE TROOPS DESERVE. OUR SUPERIORITY IN NUMBERS,
TACTICS AND SUPPLIES HAVE YET TO BE REWARDED WITH THE DECISIVE VICTORY
WHICH COULD DRIVE THE BRITISH ONCE MORE FROM THE PENINSULA.

OUR GREATEST WEAKNESS IS THE FREQUENT DELIVERY INTO OUR ENEMIES' HANDS OF
LETTERS DESCRIBING OUR INTENTIONS. WE OFTEN SEE THEIR OBSERVERS FLITTING AROUND
US, AND WHILE OUR FIELD CIPHERS HAVE BEEN USED TO SOME EFFECT, THE
OFFICERS COMMANDED BY THEIR POSTMASTER SCOVELL HAVE FOUND IT FAR TOO EASY TO
BREAK THE MORE ELEMENTARY CIPHERS IN COMMON USE BY OUR ARMIES.

IT IS MOST URGENT THAT WE SHOULD ADOPT A MORE SECURE FORM OF COMMUNICATION,
AND I URGE YOU TO PETITION MARSHAL BERTHIER FOR THE INTRODUCTION OF A GRAND
CHIFFRE FOR USE HERE IN SPAIN AND PORTUGAL. FOR NOW I PROPOSE THAT WE ADOPT
A MORE SOPHISTICATED CIPHER THAN THE ONE I HAVE ADAPTED HERE FROM THE
DALMATIAN HIEROGLYPHIC PETIT CHIFFRE.

VIVE LA FRANCE
MARMONT
