lieut. general viscount wellington, k.b., to commissary general murray.

my dear sir,

the recent promotion of scovell to the rank of major, while bought largely by the most regrettable loss of
so many of his comrades in the fifty seventh, is most richly deserved. the skill and independence of his guides plays
a vital role in our manoeuvres, and his daily post is a most remarkable engine of efficiency, facilitating
communication between the two wings of our armies.

major scovell is to be appointed to superintend all the communications of the army. the postmaster sergeants
at hq and at lisbon will place themselves under his orders, as likewise senhor oliviera, the director of the
portuguese posts. the messengers likewise will continue to receive their orders from major scovell.

he will also take full responsibility for secure communications and the deciphering of enemy intercepts. the
enemy are still close to us. you will have heard that joseph has quitted madrid: one consequence of this will be
to increase the disposable force of the french, by the number of troops constantly kept at madrid as guards
to his person. this circumstance is worthy of attention. the guides and our local friends are to focus their
most special attention on the gathering of intelligence on these new french dispositions.

believe me, etc., wellington.
