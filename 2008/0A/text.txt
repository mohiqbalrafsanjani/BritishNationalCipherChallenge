May 12th 1809

My Dearest Mary,

How delighted I am to write of our successes at Oporto. At last we won the chance to pay off some of the debt
we owed our old friend Marshall Soult for the humiliation of our retreat at Corunna. Our brave troops, under the
command of General Wellesley, infiltrated Villa Nova under his very nose, and with the help of local fishermen
and bargemen they were able to cross the river and drive the French from the city.

General Foy made a brave attempt to hold us at the bridge, but Wellesley’s artillery rained death upon the
French gunners and we were able to pay off the debt we owed Soult for our humiliating defeat at Corunna in
January. Hitherto the only consolation I could find in that hasty retreat was the weeks it gave us together upon
my return, but now I feel that we learned much in the earlier battles that is paying off handsomely in our current
campaign.

Just as we were forced to leave horses and artillery on the beach at Corunna, Soult’s men have abandoned
much of their wagon train and many of their guns as Soult and Loisson have retreated north. They departed
today, and I will follow tomorrow with a small cavalry reconnaissance force. With luck we may find a way to
break their rearguard and bring Soult up by his heels.

I treasure the few weeks we had together and most ardently hope to find a way for you to join me here in
Portugal, but the heat of battle demands my full attention. I will write again when I can.

Your loving husband, George
