lieut. general viscount wellington, k.b., to the earl of liverpool, secretary of state.

my lord,

the enemy's whole army, and all the cavalry which could be collected, gathered at ciudad rodrigo on the
second of this month. they had fought, as we had expected, to the gates of torres vedras, where, under the
command of marshall massena, one of the most talented of the french officers, they suffered a heavy defeat.
we followed them out of portugal, and further fighting has been concentrated around the border forts.

we surrounded the french garrison at almeida, and massena's forces were blocked as they tried to return to
its defence. they were checked again and forced to retire at fuentes d'onoro, which was defended in a most
gallant manner by lieut. colonel williams, in command of the light infantry battalion belonging to major
general picton's division.

massena sent orders for the garrison to try to fight its way out, and several of his messages were intercepted
by scovell's guides. it was to our great misfortune that one of the messengers evaded our scouts, and on may
eleventh the french battalions broke out, leaving a mined and ruined fort.

this great misfortune notwithstanding, the french armies have been forced back on their heels. they rely
increasingly on simple substitution ciphers to conceal their intentions, and the remarkable work of
scovell and his guides in the interception and decryption of these messages does much to supplement our
intelligence work.

i have the honour to be, etc., wellington.
