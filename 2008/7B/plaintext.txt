from the governor of badajoz to marshall soult at seville

marshall soult

i write to alert you to the imminent loss of the fort at badajoz and
its garrison of five thousand of our finest troops enemy soldiers are
even now within sight and once picurina falls they will be within
artillery range our gunners are trained and ready and any attempt upon
the fort will cost wellington dearly our engineers have reinforced the
breaches in the walls with massive earthworks and chevaux de frise
bristling with the finest spanish steel the ditches have been mined
and our troops hardened by their experience in the second siege are
kept at a high state of readiness to repulse the assault when it comes
for come it must the rain which hampers the efforts of our enemy to
cross the guadiana will eventually stop and then picurina will almost
certainly fall

your previous engagement with beresford's army at the battle of albuera
bought us the time we needed to leave the fort and destroy most of the
allied siegeworks

i beseech you to come once more to our aid lest the city should fall
into enemy hands

your most humble servant
major general phillipon
