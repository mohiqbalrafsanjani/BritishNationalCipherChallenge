lieut. general the hon. sir a. wellesley, k.b., to commissary general murray.

my dear sir,

i have received your letter concerning the establishment of the guides, and scovell is to be
congratulated on his most excellent training regime. once provisioned, the guides are to join our main
force at badajoz.

it is clear to me that soult's intention will be to cut off our line of retreat and it is therefore
necessary that we prepare a defensive line to the rear at torres vedras. to this end colonel fletcher
will build a series of ditches, forts and other emplacements to slow any attack upon that line. these works
must be duly provisioned by your measures to procure money for bills upon england.

to better our odds of success, scovell's guides are to organise a campaign of guerilla action, harrying the
french forces at every turn, and he is instructed to expand his network of spies. in this he will work with
the portuguese brigades commanded by beresford and hardinge.

the attached communication was forwarded to me from the spanish guerillas, who found it in the possession
of a most unfortunate monk, presumably an afrancasado. the message remains closed to me, and i would be
grateful if you would convey its meaning as a matter of the highest priority. this may properly be another
task for scovell, whose work in this field is not unnoticed among the general staff.

believe me, etc. arthur wellesley.
