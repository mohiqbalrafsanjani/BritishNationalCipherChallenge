To Marshall Soult from the hand of General Foy

Mon Frere Marshall, the attack on Oporto was, as we had hoped, severely hampered by the demolition of the
bridge at Villa Nova, and the scuttling of the ferries, and British casualties were severe. Nonetheless, the
treacherous local enemy sympathizers – watermen and bargemen – assisted them in crossing the river
upstream, and climbing the steep cobbled street to the top of the hill they were able to take the seminary
guarding a secure landing place.

Recognizing the danger, I ordered three battalions to attack in order to secure this point, but Wellesley,
anticipating this move, had established artillery emplacements upon a hill overlooking the river, and these guns
wrought terrible injury upon our own brave soldiers as they attempted to train their guns upon the landing site.
The reinforcements you sent enabled us to effect an orderly evacuation of guns and stores and we mounted
three further assaults upon the seminary, but with losses mounting under the barrage we were forced to retreat,
this time with loss of much of our wagon train.

General Loisson attempted to secure a line to the east, but the English, under Beresford's command, have cut
off this escape. I will follow this message as we seek to rejoin you and I await your further orders.

Vive La France,

General Foy.
