to general soult from the hand of king joseph

i read with great pleasure of the sweeping move of our army towards
a most desirable meeting with general wellesley and his forces i most
strongly urge you to engage with him at the earliest opportunity and
to bring to a timely end this dreadful british incursion into portugal

the afrancesados tell me that the british are encamped at badajoz the
defenses to their rear are weak and you should make all possible haste
to torres vedras in order to cut off any retreat from that point their
defeat will surely be only a matter of time as our superior forces
under the command of marshal massena bear down on the british from
the north south and east with their retreat blocked the british will
certainly fight on and attempt to break out into spain

it is of utmost import that we take and hold the forts at badajoz
almeida and ciudad rodrigo general nye's forces will be placed at your
disposal and together you will have command of more than thirty
thousand men given that wellesley can muster only eighteen thousand
victory must be assured

vive la france

king joseph
