major george scovell to the office of the duke of wellington

my lord

the enclosed message confirms much that we had already surmised
the french armies of the peninsula are in some disarray their
leadership under question even by napoleon himself and under
pressure of time to effect a victory the orders therein threaten
to disperse their northern armies as they hunt the guerillas and
to divert their forces from the forts at badajoz and ciudad rodrigo

the sophistication of their field cyphers has increased and the use
of padding to disguise signatures and salutations reduces the
effectiveness of two of our most effective weapons the further
introduction of additional characters to encode the more familiar
letters disguised the distribution of the more common letters and
forced us to a more sophisticated analysis of the text i remain
confident that even with the introduction of their forthcoming
grand chiffre there is hope that we will continue to break their
cyphers but this work is increasingly hard and will require greater
resources than i currently have at my disposal

i remain etc major scovell
