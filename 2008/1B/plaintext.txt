to general loisson from the hand of marshal soult

the battle to secure our route north through the mountains has shown clearly that we must not underestimate the
resolve and initiative of wellesley and his officers. the rearguard action at salalmonde came close to a
phyrric victory when the birtish, with portugese support, attempted to sabotage the bridge at ponte nova. even when
we retook the bridge, the collapse of our rearguard led to many losses, and we were lucky that our pursuers
missed the narrow road that we took out of the valley.

it is clear that command of troops is of secondary importance to command of the roads, bridges and other strategic
objectives and this pales in significance to knowledge of our enemies' intentions. to this end you are commanded
to secure a network of local sympathizers, afrancesados, who will assist us in mapping the terrain and in
gathering intelligence concerning the movement and dispositions of the british troops.

our first goal must be to bottle up the british army within portugal, and to locate their forces. we have
superiority of numbers and must take the initiative in engaging with their forces before they can entrench and
mount a full assault. the afrancesados will play an important role in locating them, and you should make their
recruitment and training your highest priority.
