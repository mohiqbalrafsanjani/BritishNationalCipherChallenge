dear barley cabbage,
i am very disappointed to find out your choice of pseudonym. i fear you are not taking this seriously! as you know, the dragonlettes aim to provide anonymous funding for any venture required z a noble aim, not to be besmirched by a ridiculous name!
on a lighter note, i would like to enquire as to how the difference engine is coming along, and am pleased to be able to offer you the sum of five hundred pounds for the completion of this venture.
it is a strange whim of yours that i must write to you in cipher, but given the propensity of some of our members to mathematics, i shall enquire as to devices i can use to occupy your time in these letters.
regards,
smaug
