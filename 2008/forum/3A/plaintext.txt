DEAR BARLEY CABBAGE,

THERE IS NO WAY WE WILL BE ABLE TO PROCURE ANY MORE FUNDING
FOR THE DIFFERENCE ENGINE. THERE ARE NOT MANY SUBSCRIBERS TO
THE DRAGONLETTES, SO WE ONLY HAVE A LIMITED BUDGET FOR EACH
REQUEST. PLEASE NOTE: A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT HAS BEEN SPENT ON YOU.

PERHAPS YOU WILL BE MORE SATISFIED WITH THIS CIPHER. IT IS A
TRANSPOSITION CIPHER WHICH HAS BEEN USED BEFORE IN A SOURCE I
AM SURE YOU HAVE READ.

REGARDS,
SMAUG
