dear smaug,
i did not know i had chosen a pseudonym. clearly there is some trickster inside the system! according to rule fourteen, subsection c, there is no possibility of my changing my deplorable appellative, so it appears i am stuck with it.
please improve your ciphers they are ridiculously easy at present! i warn you, my next correspondence will be with a full-on substitution, so be prepared!
is there no chance of any more funding? five hundred is woefully small for my requirements.
thank you for your speedy response,
charles
