dear barley cabbage,

i note with distress that you have switched your attentions
from the difference engine to the cracking of the vigenere
cipher. whilst this is indeed a noble cause, we would desire
you to concentrate fully on the engine; otherwise you risk
withdrawal of funding.

as a side note, i would like you to use a stronger method of
encryption for your messages. a full-on substitution does not
pose me any problems. i am raising the stakes in this message
with a substitution and nulls to preempt your attempt.

regards,
smaug
