I call this a "periodic affine cipher". Like Vigenere, it is cut into slices, but each
slice undergoes an affine substitution rather than a Caesar shift. All of the affine
substitutions share the same multiplier, but they have different offsets. The offsets
spell a key phrase.

multiplier = 7
key phrase (offsets) = AGRICOLAE MORTEM

(Why is it in the accusative case?)

Harry says it's an affine cipher, followed by Vigenere. So decrypt in the reverse order:
Vigenere with key AGRICOLAE MORTEM, then affine with multiplier 7 and offset 0.

Because it is a monoalphabetic substitution (the affine cipher) followed by a Vigenere,
this is a type 1 polyalphabetic substitution cipher, also called Quagmire I. But then
the keys are AGRICOLAEMORTEM for the shifts, and NCRGVKZODSHWLAPETIXMBQFUJY for the
alphabet. Note that the alphabet key is the substitution key for an affine cipher with
multiplier 15 and offset 13.

But wait, there's more! Possibly because of the regularity in an affine cipher's
key alphabet, this challenge can also be solved as a type 2 (Quagmire II) cipher,
which can be thought of as a Vigenere followed by a monoalphabetic substitution.
In this case, the shift key is AGRICOLAEMORTEM and the alphabet key is
AHOVCJQXELSZGNUBIPWDKRYFMT, which is the substitution key for an affine cipher
with multiplier 7 and offset 0. Note that if you try to decrypt the affine cipher
first, then you need to use AMVQECJAIYCVZIY as the Vigenere key; but this is
just the decryption of AGRICOLAEMORTEM under the affine cipher.
