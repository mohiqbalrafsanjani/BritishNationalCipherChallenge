with hindsight an opportunity for peace was thrown away calgacus may
have been a traitor but he was born a roman and had forged the local
tribes into an organised and disciplined force it may have been
possible to treat with him bringing caledonia within the empire in
exchange for the governorship of caledonia but salustius was a greedy
and ambitious man for whom victory was everything he had no wish to
share caledonia or glory with calgacus and thus conceived a plan to
repay the treachery of the caledonii in full he made a great fanfare
of pushing his forces into northern caledonia to the remote fort of
inchtuthil salustius in secret had conceived a sly and audacious plan
cato was instructed to proceed with an expeditionary force from
eboracum to the frontier fort at inchtuthil where he would relieve
the ii legion adiutrix pia fidelis who were required in dacia he
quickly established the legion in a state of battle-readiness and was
joined there by salustius who took command of the ix legion
humiliating the faithful cato in front of his own men salustius was
no strategist but in tactics and cunning he knew no parallel from the
legion's extensive scouting network he had learned that calgacus had
established his headquarters in the mountains west of stracathro the
marching camp leaving cato in charge of a small holding force of two
cohorts at inchtuthil salustius ostentatiously led the rest of the
ix legion to stracathro he set up camp and laid waste to the villages
around him in an act of gross provocation and cruelty he emulated his
hero crassus knowing that the many caledonii who suffered a gruesome
end on his caledonian way were not involved with calgacus and his
revolt they were just fodder in his attempt to provoke a confrontation
as he knew they must the caledonian armies mustered for a final
showdown with the legion and marched on stracathro salustius set his
forces with picket fences and traps but against the scale of the
caledonian force there was little hope of success nonetheless with
their pride at stake and accepting their fate the legionnaires of the
ixth watched and waited to join battle under cover of darkness and
before any skirmish could be conducted salustius secretly set out with
a small force of hand-picked soldiers who had travelled with him from
rome with a devious plan to steal the codex from right under calgacus'
nose salustius was a very unpleasant man but he was widely read and
knew of the hebrew tale of gideon he set his guard at key points around
the perimeter of the caledonian camp and in the depths of night when
all men are at their lowest ebb they rose as one breaking cover and
making noise like a much larger army in the confusion salustius's
lieutenant stole into the camp and made away with the codex returning
it to salustius who remained throughout at a safe distance

perhaps salustius cared nothing for the fate of the ixth legion
perhaps its destruction was part of domitian's planned revenge or
perhaps it was just a diversionary tactic to have them camped at
stracathro but the outcome was the same roused by the surprise
invasion of their camp the caledonian warriors launched a massive
assault on stracathro whatever his motivation in an act of the
greatest treachery salustius abandoned the ixth legion to oblivion
and set out south for the fortified port at carriden where he
intended to escape by sea from britannia with the codex he sent
a despatch to cato ordering him to retreat with all able men to
carriden raze inchtuthil to the ground and leave none of the weak
or wounded alive in order to provide nothing of value to the enemy

salustius and his guard must have thought they would be safe but
once more a proud son of rome had grossly underestimated calgacus
realising quickly that the codex was lost he set out to recover it
marching his men double-time in pursuit of the fleeing salustius
and so at carriden salustius regrouped with his trusty guard and
the remaining cohorts from inchtuthil led by the steadfast marcus
fidelius cato it was not long before the pursuing caledonian force
arrived before the gates of carriden and laid siege with their backs
to water the roman force was trapped their safety lay in a refuge
far over the sea and it is fitting that the ending of my story will
lie buried safely in their refuge at noviomagus batavorum
