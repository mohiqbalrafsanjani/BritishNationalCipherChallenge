EXAMPLE: An example of the Polybius cipher is given below. In this example I am assuming there are no letter ‘z’ in the message, therefore I can just ignore this letter in the grid below:

– 1 2 3 4 5
1 a b c d e
2 f g h i j
3 k l m n o
4 p q r s t
5 u v w x y

To encode the message: “hello” you would read off the row & column for each letter, so for h you would get 23. The message hello would be:
23 15 32 32 35.

Hope this helps – and no, the above is not the exact polybius square that was used to encode 3b.
