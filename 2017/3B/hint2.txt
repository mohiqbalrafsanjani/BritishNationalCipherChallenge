OFFICIAL CLUE: If you donâ€™t know the type of cipher, solve part a. Check out the forum page for hints on that (I just revealed the type of cipher for part a). If you have part a solved, then you know the type of cipher. Now to think, what might be a common theme with the 5 letters which are used in the cipher text? Remember it was written back in Roman times.
