maryam,

i found jodie at olympia and she has chapter six already. she had been
leading the midas operatives on a wild goose chase around selcuk making
a lot of noise about looking for the missing chapter at the temple of
artemis. that gave me time to retrieve it from jodie's friend at the
british museum, which has a collection of artefacts from the temple.
jodie says she knew we would figure out where to go next. the clue was
in the locations. the first one was at the great pyramid, the second at
the fort of qaitbay which was built from the ruins of the lighthouse at
alexandria and the third on rhodes, among the ruins of the colossus. the
knight's castle at bodrum was built from the remains of the mausoleum at
halicarnassus, hence the "grave" task of guarding the book. so all five
chapters were found at the site of one of the seven wonders of the ancient
world. the only remaining locations are the statue of zeus at olympia and
the hanging gardens of babylon, and no-one has any idea where the gardens
might have been, so the only place we could go next is olympia. the clue
at the end of chapter five points straight there, since lighting, bull and
oak are all symbols of zeus. we should be safe here because jodie's network
has sent her attackers on to london by laying a long trail of forged
documents revealing the location of chapter five. that bought us enough
time to locate and decipher chapter six.

we had been thinking about the evolution of the imperial ciphers. tacitus
used both the vigenere and beaufort ciphers which are polyalphabetic
versions of the caesar shift, and at first we assumed that chapter six
would be encrypted the same way. we were almost right.

meanwhile jodie's unexpected talent for forgery has given me an idea. i
think we might be able to turn our enemies on one another by exploiting her
gift, but i know her current focus is figuring out where on earth the
seventh wonder might be.
