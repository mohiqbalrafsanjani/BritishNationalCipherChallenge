maryam,

it is great to hear from you. we did pick up some chatter a couple of
months ago and j was mentioned there too, so we already have a file
on her. her name is jodie and she works as liaison between the british
library and the british museum, researching links between artefacts and
imperial roman texts, so that ties in with the intelligence you have
been receiving. nothing suggests that she has been involved in anything
shady and she has helped with several insurance fraud cases. she has an
interesting background. she did a phd on human migration studies, mainly
mathematical modelling, then moved on to study knowledge migration which
got her into the bibliophile circuit. after graduating she spent some
time with one of the london auction houses working on provenance before
taking her current position with the library. there really is nothing
suspicious in her background and i was inclined to write her off as a
lead, but when i got your message i decided i wanted to meet her. i tried
to set that up only to be told that she is out of country for a while.
in cairo.

i will see you there.

harry
