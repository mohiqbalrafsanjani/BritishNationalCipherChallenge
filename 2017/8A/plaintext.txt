i assume that you have left nijmegen with the real final chapter of
tacitus's last work to return to normality in london, as we agreed it
would be best to keep its discovery secret until the collector has been
given the fake by midas.

i want to thank you with all my heart for your help with breaking the
midas syndicate. the plan to replace the final chapter of tacitus's book
with a forgery would not have been possible without your skill and
knowledge. i know that harry was a little alarmed at the speed with
which you were able to produce it, and i should say that he is keeping
a careful eye on you for now, in case your otherwise spotless record
conceals a second secret career. for myself, i think that if you would
be interested, then my agency could use your skills.

once we are sure that the collector has taken custody of the fake, you
can announce the real document at the british library, and we will
release a translation of it highlighting our secret message on the dark
web. when the collector sees that, i suspect that the revenge on midas
will be swift and merciless. we will be watching, and with luck we will
also discover the identity of the collector. i think there may be great
profit in monitoring his or her connections. in order to give the document
some extra validity, we have encrypted it using the hardest of the
imperial ciphers. that way, only the collector is likely to be able to
read it.

meanwhile, it is of utmost importance that we keep you safe. the collector
does not know of your involvement in our plan, and there is no reason why
that should change. i would recommend that you return to your work at the
british library for now. they will be delighted to receive the original
copy of tacitus's final work. as i said before, harry's team will be
watching you, and that should be enough to ensure your safety.

it has been a great pleasure and privilege to work with you. i hope we
have the opportunity to work together again.
