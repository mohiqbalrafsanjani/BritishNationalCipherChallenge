OFFICIAL HINT:
If you are still struggling on 5a, firstly you may notice (if you have done a frequency analysis on all of it except the U & E part) that it is not the same as for the English language, so it is not a transposition cipher, but is one where letters have been substituted for other letters. The frequency analysis should also still provide a few spikes, thus implying it is just a simple substitution cipher. Next you need to figure out which letter in the plain text has been mapped to which letter in the cipher text. One way to do this would be to use word & find & replace (where case matters) and use lower case letters for all the plain text. The fact that the word structure is intact, this should give you a good start.
e.g. All previous part A challenges have been letters between two of the three people Harry, Maryam and Jodie. See if any of these fit the characters at the start or end of part a. Once you have done this see if you can fill in any more letters through educated guesses and using cribs (words you expect to see). Also keep a track of what letters in the plain text have become what letters in the cipher text. Then you may be able to fill in some more.

Note usually after the keyword has been used (without repetition of repeated letters) you the use the rest of the alphabet in order, e.g. with the keyword hello (which becomes helo) you would end up with:
e.g.
a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z
H E L O P Q _ S T U _ _ _ _ _ A _ C _ _ _ I J K _ _

If you had the above, then you could start to look for letters which would fill in the gaps, because after the keyword, the rest of the alphabet is just used in order. So “q” must be “B”, as this is the only letter between A & C.

Good luck.
