well, that was a surprise, and quite a relief. as i said before, no one
really knows where the hanging gardens of babylon were located, and i don't
think we would have had a chance of finding the next chapter if that was
where it was buried, but it seems that tacitus had a better idea. the
babylonian goddess of love and war was ishtar, and the ishtar gate from
babylon was one of the original seven wonders of the world. it was later
replaced by the lighthouse of alexandria, so i am not sure why tacitus
used both, but maybe because he didn't know where the hanging gardens
were either, or maybe he just wanted to confuse the uninitiated and to
add an extra layer of secrecy via confusion, a bit like he does by piling
up ciphers in these later chapters.

any way, we are in luck. the ishtar gate now lives in the pergamon museum
in berlin, and i happen to have a pass to the full collection. i am not
sure how they will feel about us dismantling it to try to find chapter
seven, but if we explain what is in it, i suspect the curator's curiosity
will overcome his natural protectiveness. perhaps there we will finally
unlock the secret of the IXth legion. that leaves the question of how we
deal with midas, and maryam has a clever idea: we should let the collector
deal with them. the russian mafia can be pretty ruthless if they feel
betrayed, and she has suggested a way we might make the thieves fall out.
it is a cunning plan, and i think i can help.
