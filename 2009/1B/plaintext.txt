babbage is pressing the treasury in the matter of the new workshop. he seems most agitated to
ensure that the already completed components and drawings should be placed in fire proof
storage, and i see many advantages in bringing the production closer, where i might keep a daily
eye upon proceedings. brunel's friend clement, the chief engineer for the project is most
reluctant to agree to the move and i shall ask the treasury if they might find the means to
persuade him.

met a most interesting parisian gentleman at the gaming tables last night who showed a marked
interest in my access to the difference engine designs. friend of niepce who worked with daguerre
on their heliograph so his enthusiasm may have been purely mechanical, but i had the impression
that his interest was more than passing, and was happy to give him the impression that my
relationship to the device might prove to be of great personal benefit. these discussions are
always difficult â€“ as much as anything, his english conversation was limited, (though not
appallingly, as some parisians' attempts are) but in all, i believe i may have allowed him to
assume that there exists for him, and for all france, the chance of a mutually beneficial
arrangement.

first things first. we must settle the issues concerning the construction of the difference
engine, lest i have nothing to sell. the development of babbage's more ambitious designs may take
many years, and i have debts i must settle now. i have hopes that the de plans i took from the
workshop in prospect place might have some value to niepce's contacts in london, though
naturally i merely hinted at the possibility.
