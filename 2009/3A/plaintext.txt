my dear miss lovelace,

without your cheerful support i might already have abandoned our project and devoted my life entirely to the
mathematical sciences at cambridge. the election in finsbury did provide a diversion, though my dismal
placing as fourth of four candidates leads me to the conclusion that parliamentary life is likely to elude
me. on a happier note my plans for a statistical society appear to be reaching fruition and i have real hope
that such an association may well be founded this very year.

your proposal that we should continue to work on the analytic engine in secret brings me great cheer. there is
nothing like a conspiracy to give life sparkle, and i believe your suggestion has much to recommend it. it is
increasingly apparent that lord pennylaine's actions, while they may be innocent, are greatly inhibiting
progress on the difference engine, and i am coming to agree with you that, in all likelihood, his efforts are
not entirely innocent. given that he may be acting against the interests of the government as well as against us, i
am concerned for our safety. it may depend on the adoption of more sophisticated cyphers than those we have
hitherto used. i flatter myself that i should be able to decypher any cryptic message you care to choose, and i
have great confidence that you will be able to decypher mine without knowledge of the key. but in order to avoid
embarrassment may i propose that our next communication should be encoded by use of that most elegant affine
cypher to which you alluded in our conversation? the arithmetic is attractive in its simplicity, and i feel
sure that pennylaine would be defeated by it.

i would also propose that we appear publicly to despair of ever completing the difference engine, allowing all
attention to focus upon it while we direct our real efforts to the design of the secret analytic engine.

yours truly, charles babbage
