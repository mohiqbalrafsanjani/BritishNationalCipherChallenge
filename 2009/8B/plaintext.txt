mes freres

the treacherous english have double-crossed us it is not yet clear what
role lord pennylaine has played in the destruction of our network in
london but its downfall was engineered with his witting or as is more
likely his witless support cocking appears to have been a double agent
all along and my spies in the london constabulary tell me that it was
he who warned them of the presence of a large number of foreign agents
at the location of the auction for the turning machine

while both the machine itself and the drawings for it were lost to us
during the raid on the auction i believe that i learned enough of its
construction to allow me to reconstruct at least some part of the design
with the help of french engineers

cocking was of no further use to us and i instructed agents to eliminate
him however he saved them the effort and expense of a french bullet
before they could reach him he died in a fantastical public experiment
involving a balloon and a new design for a parachute he will no longer
trouble us

babbage and lovelace are still working together on their computing
engines and an agent at cambridge informs me that they have plans for
a new and significantly more secure version of the turning machine
based on a somewhat enigmatic encryption method we will of course
continue to monitor their progress to impede it as necessary and to
attempt to acquire it at the appropriate juncture i believe they may
be working on this device with prof wheatstone and we will endeavour
to intercept their correspondence

lovelace and her colleagues may have won this battle to secure the
turning machine but they have not yet won the war
