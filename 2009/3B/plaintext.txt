mon cher pennylaine,

my colleagues and brothers in arms are most interested in your proposition. i firmly believe that we should be
able to come to an agreeable arrangement that should satisfy both parties in this unusual transaction. the device that
you are proffering to us has the potential to revolutionise human knowledge in the same way that the heroic
insurrectionists of july fourteenth revolutionised human affairs and political life.

as a gentlemen i am happy to accept your assurances that you are in a position to
fulfill our bargain. however, not all of my colleagues are as accustomed to the
honour of the english gentleman, and i regret that they feel it is necessary to take
further precautions to ensure that you complete the rather lengthy transaction
upon which we are now embarking. they are all too aware of the sentiment in
your parliament at present, which, shall we say, lacks a certain affection for the
republic. my companions seek further assurance that you do not have ulterior
motives for contacting me with such an interesting proposition, and they have
proposed that you might provide written details of your cabinet
deliberations concerning france and her allies as a sign of your good faith.

given the great risk to you in this affair. might i counsel you to use a rather
stronger method of secret communication in your reply? perhaps employing a
keyword cipher of some strength?

vive la france, monhier.
