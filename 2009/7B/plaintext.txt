my brothers

i must keep this message short

mr cocking has arranged the auction for the turning engine for july
twelfth and we urgently need additional funds to arrange the purchase
i am told that there are many bidders for the device and having
studied it in some depth over the last few months i can see why
it acts as a giant automated jefferson cylinder and may be used to
automate an attack upon it by generating large numbers of candidate
decryptions and using a dictionary of cribs to test them it may be
that the days of the jefferson wheel are numbered though i am inclined
to trust it for the moment

regarding the jefferson cypher itself the new cylinder arrived from
the embassy by courier late last night and i was most impressed by the
apparently completely random arrangement of the characters on the wheels
though the fact that each wheel was identical to exactly one other really
did seem an unfortunate weakening of the device nonetheless together with
the various orderings for the wheels on the axis the number of combinations
possible are beyond discernment even by the turning engine without some
other weakness in the implementation of the cypher and i will use it for
all future communications
