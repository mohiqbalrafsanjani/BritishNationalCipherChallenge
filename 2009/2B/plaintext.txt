my dear monsieur monhier

i am delighted to enclose the item you requested as you can see in
design and manufacture it is a singularly well-executed component
and i can assure you that the full mechanism in so far as it has been
completed is constructed to the same high standards the chief
engineer clement is a friend of the genius bruneland

i have the utmost confidence that without my regular interference the
project would already be close to completion it is apparent that the
benefit to your compatriots of possessing such a machine will be greatly
multiplied if they alone possess it and i might modestly claim to be
alone in the power that i have to effect such a happy outcome of course
such a situation would be of extreme benefit to you while placing me at
a considerable risk and i hope that you will appreciate the justice in
my request for an appropriate settlement for these valuable services and
products which i and i alone can offer as a token of your sincerity in
these delicate negotiations i merely ask for a small consideration a sum
of two hundred guineas should suffice if that is agreeable to you

your sp
