my dear professor babbage,

charlotte's sister emily retrieved the enclosed note from the fireplace at
lord pennylaine's london apartments last evening. i have courted her
attention assiduously and recruited her fully to our cause. this places her in
great danger, and i have severe doubts as to whether we should ask her to
continue taking risks on our behalf. indeed if it were not for emily's duty to her
king and country, and the foul threat posed by our french opponents, i am certain
that i would not ask her to take such risks.

i fear that we are all required to place the interests of others above our
own. for my own part, the frustrating delays in tackling the decryption of my
late father's enigma pain me deeply, but our work on the analytic engine must
take priority, as must our efforts to thwart our opponents.

i have taken some initial steps in attempting to decypher the message
intercepted by brave charlotte, and must confess to some confusion. the
distribution of characters within it matches that of ordinary english text
so very closely that i am of a mind to assume that no substitutions have been
made, and yet the text is clearly encrypted, perhaps by some ingenious
derangement. with your own interest in anagrams i suspect that it will yield
its secrets to you swiftly, and, if you will allow it, i will leave that task to
you, as i turn my attention to the enigma puzzle, and continue my notes on the
design of the analytic engine.

affectionately yours,
ada lovelace.
