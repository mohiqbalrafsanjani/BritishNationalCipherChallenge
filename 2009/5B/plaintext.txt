my dear mr cocking

our shared interest in the work of mr babbage and his protégé miss lovelace
is a happy circumstance that we would be foolish to ignore i very much
hope that we can find a way to exploit it to our mutual advantage

it is more than fortunate that you are already acquainted with my very
good friend monsieur monhier as i am sure that he will play a key role in
any plans that may developy

our design for an improved parachute based on the calculations of sir
george cayley have attracted attention in whitehall and i am happy to
press those with influence to consider funding the development of it
i am told that an effective demonstration of the enhanced stability that
your design should offer would do much to improve the chances that it
would be adopted by manufacturers of military hardware as you may know
the nascent possibilities presented by the hot-air balloon in taking
warfare into the skies are inhibited by the lack of a suitable method
of escape and the generals will require some convincing if we are to
persuade them of the utility of such a device

you mentioned that you believe mr babbage to be working on a new and
secret machine it would of course be of great interest to me to know
what this device might be as you know i am a great supporter of his
work in government and i would be pleased to press his case for
additional support while acting on your behalf as well i hope you will
consider this as an excellent opportunity to enhance our already fruitful
cooperation

your good friend
lord pennylaine

ps i must apologise for my tardiness in remitting the payment for the
beautiful watercolour painting of my niece an unexpected claim on my
disposable funds places me in temporary embarrassment be assured that
i will rectify this at the earliest opportunity
