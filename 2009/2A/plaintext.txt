my dearest mr. babbage,

i was most distressed to hear of the break in at the workshop last thursday evening, but i bring most shocking
news of the utmost importance. the sister of my maid charlotte has taken service in the household of lord
pennylaine and brings the following revelation. the break in appears to have been engineered by lord
pennylaine in order to demonstrate his relatively unfettered access to the machinery of the difference
engine. your reticence in confronting him appears to be well founded - he is known to be consorting with the
most unsavoury associates of niepce; agents of france and certain to be working to gain access to our
devices and inventions.

as for my late father's puzzle, professor somerville remarked that there might be a hint to the secrets of its
encryption in a poem, well known to those inhabitants of the forum as byron's enigma. you may know of it and i
certainly intend to study it as soon as i may.

your thoughts on a family of more general computing engines are most intriguing, but may i take the liberty
of suggesting that a more valuable device would be furnished by a single mechanism which might be
configured by means of a sequence of mechanical instructions to carry out various tasks. i am brought to this
suggestion by a study of the most ingenious mechanism of the jacquard loom, which, being a single
mechanism can yet be instructed by means of punctured cards to weave many remarkable and quite different
patterns. i look forward to an early opportunity to discuss these new ideas with you.

faithfully yours,
ada lovelace
