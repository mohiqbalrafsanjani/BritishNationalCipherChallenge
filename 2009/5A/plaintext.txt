my dear miss lovelace

when i consider our progress in the last two years i can scarcely
believe that we have come so far your thoughts on the construction
and design of the analytic engine and its operation have completely
revolutionised my view of what may be possible your insights into
the manufacture of an encryption engine based on the same principles
and designed to effect speedy and accurate encyphering of the most
important messages of government promises to ensure the security of
our empire for many years to come

pennylaine's constant efforts to thwart our progress with the
difference engine have played well into our hands it has been
simplicity itself to use his interference as our excuse for slow
progress on this project while diverting all our attention to the
more exciting prospects of universal computation offered by the
analytic engine the constant loss of small items and plans from
the workshop would almost certainly have gone unnoticed if not for
the remarkable intelligence provided by our mole the gallant emily
but these losses are unimportant compared to the fact that the
conspirators have been unable to gain access to our more important
new ideas

it unsettles me that a traitor should profit from our labours but
i am heartened that he is being paid by our enemies for essentially
useless intelligence

i recently found myself confiding in an old friend and colleague the
painter robert cocking he has another secret life as an agent of the
british government and his work as a portrait artist gives him access
to many drawingrooms he tells me that it is surprising how much people
will divulge while sitting for him the name of pennylaine was mentioned
and it quickly became apparent that we had a shared interest in his
activities i am not sure where this may lead but with your permission
i will follow

affectionately yours
charles babbage
