my dear miss lovelace,

our meeting could not have been more timely â€“ my recent travails had brought
low my ambition for the power of steam-powered computation but in you i found
the enthusiasm i once owned and it has rekindled my determination to finalise
the design of the world's first mechanical computing engine; perhaps one
which will assist in the task of decyphering your late father's enigma.

whether i shall be allowed to construct a larger engine of this kind, and bring
to perfection the others i described at our meeting, will in a great measure
depend on the nature of the encouragement i may receive from the government.
in this regard i would most humbly beseech you to maintain your great
discretion concerning your reservations about lord pennylaine. he has most
considerable influence on the chancellor and our future plans may depend on
his support. he showed great interest in our ideas last evening and whatever
his motivation, i feel certain it will be to the great benefit of our nation and
ourselves to gain his support for this enterprise.

the commission placed upon me, dare i now say, placed upon us, "to bring to
perfection an engine for calculating mathematical tables" falls so very far
short of our new ambition: to bring about a revolution in our means of
computation which may be brought to bear upon problems far beyond current reach
and imagination.

your faithful servant,
charles babbage
