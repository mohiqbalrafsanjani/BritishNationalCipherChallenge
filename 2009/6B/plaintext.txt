fraternal brothers

in this report i convey important news concerning the work of miss
lovelace and professor babbage our source in the british government
continues to provide intelligence concerning the development of the
difference engine vive la difference as they say however progress on
this device has been interminable and i have been most disappointed
at the lack of recent news however a new and more promising source
has appeared in our circles promising access to a new and secret
device designed and built by l and b as a mechanical replacement for
the grande chiffre and other diplomatic cyphers the principle on
which it is built is not yet known i know of no one who has seen the
machine though its name the turning engine and its provenance as
offspring of the difference engine suggest several possibilities the
earliest cypher that attributed to the great caesar is itself based
on a rotational mechanism and we can reasonably assume that the new
machine might also use an advanced system of rotors to implement a
more sophisticated version of that cypher perhaps not such a machine
is unlikely to defeat the dedicated student of codes and cyphers
without additional layers of complexity

the identity of my new source must remain secret so i will refer to
him as c c claims with good authority to have access to the hearts
and minds of our opponents and i have great confidence in his value
to our cause there is every chance that he might provide us with
immediate access to the turning engine and i would propose that we
cut our ties with lord pennylaine in favour of a more profitable
alliance with c

i must caution you that c is far shrewder than p while p was motivated
largely by fear and greed c takes a longer and more pragmatic approach
to these diplomatic affairs and is far more aware of the value of that
which he offers it may be expensive to switch our allegiance but given
the number of other powers that might wish to bid for access to the
turning engine it could be far more expensive not to do so
