my dear mr babbage

i write to tell you about the discussions i have recently held with
your friend mr cocking he tells me that he has been following pennylaine's
affairs for some time on behalf of the secretary of state the minister
has harboured suspicions himself concerning pennylaine which may have
been exacerbated by their disagreement at the gaming tables late last
year with the aid of emily mr cocking has tried with some success to
gain the confidence of the co-conspirators aiming to infiltrate their
circle he was most interested in our work and has asked if we would
consider allowing him to use it as bait to trap the more senior foreign
agents working on our shores this would have the additional advantage
of bringing discredit to lord pennylaine as a source of reliable
intelligence the intelligence officers of the european powers have
evaded every trap set for them and every attempt at capture but mr
cocking is of the opinion that for such a large prize he may be able to
draw them into the open he has in mind arranging a private auction at
which he would offer for sale our turning engine springing a trap from
which none of them would escape

i confess to feeling a little uneasy at this proposal we have worked
hard to maintain strict secrecy for the last three years concerning the
existence of the machine but i must admit i found his enthusiasm
infectious and the explanation of his plans convincing i would trust
mr cocking with my life and it appears that he has entrusted his life
to us whatever our decision concerning his proposal we must protect him

as to the decryption of my late father's enigma my research has uncovered
a series of poems bearing the title by ron's enigma of which the most
amusing begins "i am not in youth nor manhood nor age" these childish
diversions are most entertaining but shed little light on the nature of
the more serious challenge he has set for me perhaps we could invent
some clever way to utilise the power of the analytic engine and its
cryptographic cousin the turning machine to attempt to decipher the
text but i am afraid my initial thoughts on this are not promising

affectionately
