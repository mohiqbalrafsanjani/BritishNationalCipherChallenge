my dear mr babbage

i was most shocked to hear of the death of our dear friend mr cocking
and assumed immediately that all had gone awry it was with the utmost
relief that i discovered of his ingenious ruse to escape the attention
of the french assassins by faking his death it was a most gruesome end
and i shudder to think of those unfortunates who witnessed it believing
it to be true where he obtained a corpse suitable for the deception i
do not know and do not care to ask i am even more puzzled at how the
body may have been concealed in the basket but this is of no account
i am truly happy to have received news that he is well and i wish him
continued good health of course

the first major challenge for the turning engine now it has been safely
returned to us will be the decryption of the enclosed cyphertext
discovered in the house believed to have been used by agent monhier as
a safe refuge the broken wheels discovered in another room lead me to
believe that this monhier's final message has been encrypted using the
jefferson cypher alluded to in his previous letter it appears from the
fragments that the device used twenty-six wheels each with a random
alphabet of the standard characters but i recall that monsieur monhier
asserted that each wheel was identical to another i have managed to
reconstruct the first of the wheels in their entirety from the fragments
and the letters on these discs read as follows

    wheel one:      himqebnyulwtascvojprxzfgdk
    wheel two:      blaxcvshirwpfyqodetmnjkzgu
    wheel three:    eadzmijyksrxvqtlpuchnwgbof
    wheel four:     lhrtsouazkxedibwyvpfngmjcq
    wheel five:     aoebmunwjycgxqzvhlstkrdpfi
    wheel six:      hbtwosivqrdpygnxuzlafckejm
    wheel seven:    obqzgrlkxatpnsyewvdfijumch
    wheel eight:    imrwvulbdkoqhaetpgzsyfcnjx
    wheel nine:     ruhcesjaxmnzogvbqtkdwilpyf
    wheel ten:      sazorcietfykxmdpgwqvuhlbnj
    wheel eleven:   quaihjmceztkyfvlpbxosgrwnd
    wheel twelve:   mucatpjzoxewifqhbsrglydknv
    wheel thirteen: qwlckuetdivphfamzoybrsgxnj

this gives me considerable hope that we might crack monsieur monhier's
jefferson cypher with the aid of a little luck perhaps a crib and the
power of the new computing engines available to us

i must say that the life i have led since meeting you my dear prof
babbage has been much more exciting than i could possibly have
imagined the gaming tables seem tame by comparison our work on the
turning engine on its successor and on the analytic engine has
wrought a revolution in my life and i believe will do the same for
many others

when time permits i will return to the question of my father's enigma
but the pressing needs of the nation and of mathematics call me away
once more and i am delighted to serve them both in your company

with much affection
ada lovelace
