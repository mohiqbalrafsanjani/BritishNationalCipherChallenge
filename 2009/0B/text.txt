1833 Diary of Pennylaine - 6th June

To Mary Somerville's last night - met her rather precocious protégé the young Miss Lovelace. One of the
brighter stars in the constellation, but with a rather high regard for her own talents. Still she is increasingly to be
seen in the smarter gaming houses and makes a welcome change from some of the more tedious players, with
their never ending reminders of my credit notes.

Of surprisingly more interest - Babbage was in attendance - Lucasian Professor at Cambridge - typical
academic; head in the clouds, always talking to the world but never saying anything of real importance - apart
from one ingenious idea. Had previously heard of these infernal plans of his for calculating machines to replace
the rooms of computers upon whom we currently rely, but hadn't realised the possible uses of such a device in
the gaming parlours. After last night's diversions I begin to see a new way to steer a course out of troubles and,
with time and thought, a plan may crystallise around the possibilities outlined by young Miss Lovelace and her
admiring retinue.

To Cabinet in the morning - will raise the possibility of support for Babbage and his invention - why not ask the
Exchequer to invest in my future fortune? After all I have given the Nation it does not seem too much to expect.
