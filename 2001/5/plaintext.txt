It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of
wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it
was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of light, it was the
season of darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of
despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we
were all going direct to heaven, we were all going direct the other
way--in short, the period was so far like the present period, that
some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, for
good or for evil, in the superlative degree of comparison only.

This is a Playfair cipher. Sir Charles Wheatstone invented it in the
middle of the nineteenth century. He named his invention after his
good friend Lyon Playfair, the first Baron Playfair, St. Andrews. It
was used right up until the First World War.
