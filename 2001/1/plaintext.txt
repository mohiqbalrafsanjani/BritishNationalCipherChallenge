The first documented use of a substitution cipher for
military purposes appears in Julius Caesar's Gallic Wars. Caesar
describes how he sent a message to Cicero, who was besieged and
on the verge of surrendering. The substitution replaced Roman
letters with Greek letters, rendering the message unintelligible to
the enemy.
