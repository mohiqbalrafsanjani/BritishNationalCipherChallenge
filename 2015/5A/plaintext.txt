harry, i checked out who transcribed the radio transmission like you
asked. it was a junior cipher clerk in room 5. i would have offered
to set up a meeting with her, but she has disappeared and hasn't been
seen since last friday. the marines saw her leave at her usual time,
and she was booked out for some leave on monday and tuesday so no one
noticed she was missing until today. we sent an officer out to her
usual haunts and i will get back to you if we find anything. what made
you ask? did you have a reason to believe she was involved in something?

i took another look at the messages. were you referring to the typos?
the word ratlines keeps being spelt as ratilines. is that important?
what did you mean about our source being close to home?

also did some digging about the reichsdoktor. seems you were right
and it refers to an underground nazi organisation dedicated to
rebuilding the reich. maybe they think of it as healing? a bunch
of rich nazi sympathisers took over the ratlines from a group of ss
officers who set them up at the tail of the war and have been active
in shipping scientists, engineers and soldiers to towns across south
america. if our source has inside information then maybe we could
intercept the lines and pick up some of the high value targets the
french are after. what was "die alchemisten project"?

the enclosed message was handed to the marines, but they didn't get
a name. initial analysis shows it must be a vigenere cipher with period
two so it should be reasonably straightforward to crack.

all the best, charlie
