charlie, the attached note was left in one of my dead drops last night
and appears to be from our mysterious source. it contains two really
significant pieces of intelligence. the first is that the riechsdoktor
might not refer to an individual after all. it seems to be the codename
for the organization running the ratlines. according to my other sources
this is a collection of routes, agents and safe houses used to transport
nazi sympathisers and war criminals out of germany and on to south america.
we have known that such an organisation exists since the end of the war,
but this is the first time i have seen it named. the other piece of
information is much more subtle. i am beginning to wonder if our source
is closer to home than we had realised. and i am not referring to francois!
see if you can spot the two things i noticed. by the way, who transcribed
the radio intercept you sent me last week? harry
