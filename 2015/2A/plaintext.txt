charlie, no need to apologise, life was getting dull behind a desk
and i was glad to have an excuse to fly back to europe. i am intrigued
about the reichsdoktor - i hadn't come across this before, when did you
first come hear of it?

i think i may already be making some progress. on arrival i found a
postcard waiting for me on the mat at the embassy with no message on
it. at least that's what it looked like at first. i did notice that
the letters on the front could be highlighted to pick out the phrase
the reichsdoktor so unless that is an extraordinary coincidence i
figured it must be related to our investigation. the strangest thing
was that the postcard had a stamp but no postmark on it, so it can't
have been posted. since it wasn't signed i assume they wanted to stay
anonymous and i couldn't see why they would have taken the risk of
hand delivering it, but in the end i worked it out. there was a hidden
message. i'll leave it to you to figure out where it was hidden. anyway
i've attached the message i found. i know that relations with three of
the four powers are relatively stable, but i think we need to keep this
to ourselves for now. all the best,

harry
