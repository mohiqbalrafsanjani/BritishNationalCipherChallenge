The deck is keyed with the first paragraph of the Preface to the First
German Edition in Karl Marx's Capital: A Critical Analysis of Capitalist
Production, Volume 1.

    The work, the first volume of which I now submit to the public,
    forms the continuation of my "Zur Kritik der Politischen Oekonomie"
    (A Contribution to the Criticism of Political Economy) published in
    1859. The long pause between the first part and the continuation is
    due to an illness of many years' duration that again and again
    interrupted my work.
