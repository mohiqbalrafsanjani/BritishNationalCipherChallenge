According to past participants, here is the original deck given:

    13H,9H,8S,4C,5C,3S,
    4D,13S,7D,13C,A,3D,
    4H,1S,12H,8H,4S,1D,
    2S,7C,1H,5S,1C,6C,
    7H,2D,B,10H,5D,11D,
    3C,9C,12S,11H,10D,0,
    0,0,0,0,0,0,
    0,12D,0,0,0,0,
    0,0,6H,0,3H,0

Here, "0" denotes an unknown value, 11 = jack, 12 = queen, 13 = king,
A = joker A, B = joker B, C = clubs, D = diamonds, H = hearts, S = spades.

The challenge organizers have promised an original image, and I will
post it when it arrives. Meanwhile, I have posted a reconstructed image.
