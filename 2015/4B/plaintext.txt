the french may be your allies but they are not your friends they plan
to infiltrate the ratilines and to try to turn the high-value targets
for themselves they have a particular interest in nazi scientists from
the die alchemisten project if you want to break the reichsdoktor
network before they can do so take care not to share any intelligence
with them you have been warned

i think it is time to begin negotiations i have a number in mind and i
think once you know what i am offering you will find it very reasonable
as a sign of good faith i offer you the following information one of
the local ratiline coordinators will be leaving the us sector tomorrow
night in a black limousine under the back seat of his car you will find
hidden a junior ss officer who is trying to escape and in the trunk you
will find a number of papers relating to stolen artworks that he hopes
to trade to the french for his freedom

you might want to consider carefully whether you can trust your friend
charlie with this information after all her husband francois is french
