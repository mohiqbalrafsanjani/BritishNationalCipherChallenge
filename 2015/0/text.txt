My name is Harry,
I am a spy-hunter, a codebreaker, a
mathematician. I work with British &
American Intelligence, and if they have
called me in you know they are in
trouble.

This is a story about my time in Berlin
just after the war, when the allies were
still working together. They gave me a
mission to track down an agent known
as the Reichsdoktor, and it was one of
the hardest I ever had to deal with.

Maybe you would have done better.
