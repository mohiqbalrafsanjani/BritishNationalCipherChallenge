harry,

the puzzle of the stamped postcard had me fooled for a while, but
i think i figured it out. was the message on the back of the stamp?
i am guessing you steamed it off and found it there. it was a pretty
ingenious ploy.

my masters back in washington are increasingly worried about our
relationship with the rest of the four powers. following the breakdown
in trust with the soviets they are counting on the uk and france as
allies. if they are going behind our backs with this reichsdoktor,
that does not bode well for future diplomacy. do you have contacts
there you can exploit to find out what they are intending? we really
cannot afford to fall out right now.

the attached message is another intercept, this time from the british
embassy wireless. while things are dicey i don't feel i can ask them
about it, maybe you could crack it for us. does it mention the ratlines?

best,
charlie
