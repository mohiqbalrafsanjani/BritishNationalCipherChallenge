the first item in our little auction will be the location of a safe
house in the uk sector of berlin it is a minor stopover on the
ratlines but you never know you might get lucky and find someone
interesting hiding there at the very least you will inconvenience
the reichsdoktor if you take possession of it how much would that
be worth to you do i hear a bid of five hundred thousand francs
from our french friends perhaps the british would pay more or maybe
they cannot afford to i wonder how they feel about that perhaps you
should ask them if you want to outbid your so-called friends then
leave the money in unmarked treasury bills in locker 157 at the far
end of the platform in friedrichstrasse i will leave the details in
locker 159 you will find the key in 157 do not try to double-cross
me it will not work and our little game will end before it has even
properly begun
