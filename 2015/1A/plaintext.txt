harry, sorry to drag you back in, we were hoping to give you some time
off after the last case, but something came up and we need your help.

at a meeting of the four powers allied control council two weeks ago
the french accused the russians of sheltering a nazi medic known as
the reichsdoktor. apparently they intercepted a morse code radio
broadcast from the russian sector of berlin in which the doctor was
offering intelligence about the ratlines in exchange for asylum. the
russians claimed not to know anything about it, and maybe they are
telling the truth, but things have been a little frosty since truman's
speech on march twelfth and we really don't need more conflict right
now. we figure with your contacts over here you might be able to find
out if the russians are telling the truth. i have attached the encrypted
transcript of the broadcast.
