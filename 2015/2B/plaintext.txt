if you really want to get in the middle of this you will have to pay
i know you will be hunting me and i can forgive the arrogance but i
will not forgive your ignorance before you can learn more about the
ratlines from me you will have to ask your colleagues in french and
british intelligence what they already know powerful forces are working
to keep the ratlines running and we both need to know who our enemies
are before we can meet you should understand that without me your
investigations will gain little negotiations with me may gain everything
