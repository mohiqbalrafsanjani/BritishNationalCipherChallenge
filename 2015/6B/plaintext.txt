The Americans have robbed you, rather than trying to outbid you they got to the lockers first and arranged to steal your money and the valuable intelligence I provided for you. They cannot be trusted. None of your allies can be trusted. They believe that they can cheat you, but they do not understand that you can only cheat in a game and this is not a game. If you try to play a game of chess like your “allies” we will find ourselves in a stalemate. You have been warned. So let us start again. I can let you have the address of another safe house at a small discount on our original price, and I will include the identity of a British double agent working in your Embassy. Shall we say four hundred thousand Francs? To be paid directly to an account of my choosing. If you want to know more about the treachery of your so called friends then let us meet in the park by the British Embassy on Friday at eleven.
