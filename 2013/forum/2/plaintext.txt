the gas weapon developed by the fabulists had one distinctive feature:
the strange red marks that afflicted everyone affected by it. this was
their undoing. i began to gather accounts of these marks appearing on
the bodies of our own men, and it became apparent to me that valentine
and proteus had sold the gas to our enemies. i labored for many years
to gather evidence of their treachery, but they were skilled in deception,
and i was never able to establish their guilt beyond reasonable doubt.
the fabulists proved too valuable to the establishment, and an uneasy
truce settled between us. they were unsure how much i knew, and i was
unsure what risk they posed to us both. while they could not be certain
what proof i might have lodged with a third party, they did not dare
take action against me.
