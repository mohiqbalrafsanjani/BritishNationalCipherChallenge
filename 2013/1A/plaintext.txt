dear phil,

how could i pass up the opportunity to work on this? i had a crack
at another of the notes you found in montmartre. it looks like the
oldest item in the packet and i thought it might be a good place to
start. it makes some sense of the buchenwald reference in the later
note you sent.

it didn't explain the paris link so i sent a team into that
neighbourhood to gather intel but they didn't come up with very
much. we did get one report that the house had been owned by a
german family before the war, but that it had been taken over by
an ss officer in nineteen forty one. surete records suggest that
the family came from weimar in august nineteen thirty seven, which
is suggestive given the timing and the geography, so i have sent
the team to buchenwald to see what they can find.

i am jumping to conclusions here, but the portrait sarah mentions
has to be the mona lisa. i have been trying to get access to it,
but the french authorities are spooked. the theft of the painting
by peruggia back in nineteen eleven has made them very sensitive.
the name chaudron was mentioned more than once, and i need some
time to look into the history.

if you have any influence at all at the museum i think we need
a proper examination of the painting, and i need to know what
happened to it during the war.

all the best,

harry
