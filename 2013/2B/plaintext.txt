helmut's cousins are i suppose kind in their own way but there is little
warmth in the kindness i receive anna tries to make me comfortable but
she is afraid the ss officer who brings us the paintings is cruel and
cowardly and he beats anna if my work is not good enough he is scared
that if he beats me he might damage my hands and too scared to beat her
husband daniel a bear of a man who towers over him it doesn't matter the
real power lies with the bully he could have us all shot and we all know it

daniel scares me too but only because he reminds me of helmut and that
reminds me of the camp he never speaks never looks me in the eye and never
wants anything from me i think he hates me for bringing the ss to his
house but for anna's sake he brings me what i need

what i most need is a way out of here when i am gone anna's beatings will
stop and maybe daniel will stop hating me but i am watched all day and the
house is locked at night that will not stop me from trying
