peruggia is an interesting connection he stole the painting and took it
to italy before the war and no one knows what happened to it during the
years it was missing given how long it was away i can understand the
french reluctance to let go of it again

i followed up your lead on chambord and discovered that the louvre's
paintings were transferred to louvigny the abbaye de loc dieu the
musee de montauban and finally to montal under the supervision of the
museum's director jacques jaujard but i have a feeling we are missing
something in all this just can't put my finger on it

chasing up the background story on our young painter it seems like her
family have had a long interest in art restoration and i guess that is
where she learned her skills but her obvious understanding of a forger's
work make me wonder if someone in the family maybe the much loved
grandfather had a less obvious source of income can you find out more
about them what part of italy did the family come from originally

i will need that x-ray of the painting as soon as you can get it done
i have a hunch the old lady is hiding more than her feelings behind
that smile

all the best
