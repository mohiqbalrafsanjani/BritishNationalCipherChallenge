Herr Goering,

It is with mixed feelings that I must report the loss of the Jewish painter and the consequent closure of the forgery factory run by Sturmbannfuhrer Falschung. We had intended to arrest him and to raid the factory when the current batch of paintings had been completed but the unfortunate escape of the young woman rather spoilt our plans. I must confess that this was my own misjudgement. I had delayed the arrest intending to present you with one of the forgeries myself in recognition of your support for the ERR, and in acknowledgement of your own exquisite taste in art. These forgeries, though incomplete, will astound you. The materials, pigments, boards, and so on, are themselves masterpieces and the reputation of this girl and of her family are fully deserved. She no doubt flees in fear of her life, but should we capture her no such fate awaits. This extraordinary gift should be set free, and I propose that we detain her indefinitely in a fully equipped studio at Obersalzberg. Who knows what treasures this canary might produce for us. Herr Falschung has been stripped of rank and is being returned to Berlin for trial. It is clear that his plan was always to steal the painting and to present you with a forgery in its place, and my own instinct was to have him shot for looting, but perhaps you will consider better ways to make use of him, if only as an example.

The girl appears to have stolen, or perhaps more likely forged, documentation, and was spotted boarding a train at Paris Lyon. The locomotive was intercepted at Ventimiglia, but a full search revealed no-one matching her description. Thankfully all the paintings she was working on are fully accounted for and the original has been returned to our vault in the Jeu de Paume. Given what we now know, I believe that she will have returned to the Ghetto, and I will travel there myself in hope of finding a lead. Perhaps the fates will be kind to us,

Heil Hitler.
