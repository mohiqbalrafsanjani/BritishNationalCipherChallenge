Harry,

I think you might be interested in this telegram, sent as morse code. Our agents at the telegraph company have been looking out for unusual traffic and noticed that the message has strong encryption, so they forwarded it to me for investigation. Unfortunately all my resources are tied up hunting for Nazi rocket scientists, but I noticed that the telegram was intended for a recipient in Venice and I wonder if it might be connected with Sara and her family.

Hope it is of value,

Phil.
