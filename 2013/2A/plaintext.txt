harry,

i cashed in a favour with a friend in the surete and he got me access
to the picture. our guys can have fifteen minutes with her after closing
time on friday. they won't allow anything too invasive but we should get
some pictures of the canvas and frame, and they are offering to brief us
on the painting's movements during the war.

records from buchenwald were sketchy but we traced the family that owned
the apartment in montmartre. as you guessed, they moved there when
buchenwald opened. the father, daniel, was jewish, though they seem to
have managed to conceal that fact. some of them moved to switzerland,
the others to france, though the team did hear reports that daniel's
brother in law was more or less forced to take up work as a guard in the
camp so we have another link between the family and our mysterious artist.

how she got to france is a mystery, travel for a young jewish girl would
have been hazardous unless she was carrying official papers. we will try
to track down the buchenwald guard though i don't hold up much hope. no
one who did that job put it on their cv afterwards.

phil
