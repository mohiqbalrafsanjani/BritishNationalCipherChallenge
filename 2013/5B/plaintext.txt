it is time to run she is ready and so am i i stole daniel's pocketbook
this afternoon when he left his jacket hanging on the easel in the attic
i jump everytime i hear a footstep on the stairs certain that the theft
has been discovered and that i will be caught

the ss officer visits less often now that he is sure i am carrying out
their instructions i can never be certain when he will next appear but
he seemed satisfied with my work this afternoon and perhaps he will not
return tomorrow

daniel is often out during the day so with luck my escape will not be
discovered until the afternoon and i plan to be aboard the train by then
my documents are ready too they would not bear a close inspection but if
i can steal aboard a full train then i think they will suffice the journey
to the station will be difficult in the blackout but my map is clear and
the matches i stole will give me enough light to check the way

i will hide this diary under the boards in the cellar where she has
lived for the last few months if anything happens to me i do not want
our story forgotten perhaps one day i will return and retrieve it if
not and you are reading this then wish me luck

sarah
