Grandfather,

The Nazi hunters seem to have lost my trail about eight months ago, shortly after I left Italy. I travelled over the mountains to Switzerland and stayed there with my cousins for five months, before crossing the Alps again into Austria. Travelling by night I journeyed through the Balkans into Greece. It had been my childhood dream to see the home of the great artists and thinkers of antiquity, but my journey was a nightmare of discomfort and fear, eased only by the kindness of the partisans who sheltered me and, eventually, found me transport across the Mediterranean.

In North Africa I found Allied soldiers willing to give me passage to England, and once there I began to make plans to retrieve the painting from the Ghetto in Venice and return her to Leonardo's home in France. She is safe at last, hidden in Clos Luce; I am certain that no one will think to look for her there. As you taught me, the board is hidden in plain sight - I laminated the back and sides of the poplar board with thin oak strips and shaped it as one of the panels in the walls. If something should happen to me you will find her easily - there are two knots staring out from the panel where Lisa del Giocondo's eyes would be.
I will travel onwards now to America where no-one knows who I am. Many Jewish girls are settling there and I will be one among thousands, perhaps millions, making a new life in a new world. I pray that you will be able to join me there one day.

With all my love,

Sara
