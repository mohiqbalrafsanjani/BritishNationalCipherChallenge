good call on the nazi paper trail the attached is a memo from paris high command
to goering's secretary referring to the painting and clearly mentioning sara
seems like they knew about the scam our friendly ss officer was planning to pull
they picked up her trail the night after she went missing but you can read about
that in their report

still no joy on getting access to the original miss mona in the gallery and i am
beginning to think we might need to roll out a black-bag job you want to do it or
shall i

by the way i was surprised by this report the other papers we have from the nazis
at this level are encrypted using bifid- or playfair-style ciphers this one isn't
maybe the cipher clerk was off duty that day we got lucky
