harry

this is strictly eyes only five minutes with the ol' lady was enough to
give our tech guys a headache nothing much showed under ultraviolet but
they managed to catch a scraping of varnish from the back of the painting
and found high concentrations of lead they did not expect this and we are
trying to get permission to x-ray her but the curator is not keen for her
to be moved again after the years of travel during the war

our agents are trying to track her movements during that time to see when
she might have been brought to montmartre she left paris on the twenty-
eighth of august just before the outbreak of war and travelled in a
convoy of thirty-seven trucks to a place called chambord i will let you
know if i hear any more about her travels

as for sarah we found out a little more about her family one of the
buchenwald neighbours mentioned a connection with italy which is
suggestive given the peruggia story though exactly what the connection
might be i am not sure

more when i have time
