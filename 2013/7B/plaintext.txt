Herr Goering,

It is with pride that I write to inform you that the girl Sara has been found. She is living with a gondolier in an apartment on Calle Stagneri. From our own investigation it appears that this gondolier is a member of the family that served the infamous Caravello, whose taste in art was as refined and expensive as his other tastes were crude and extravagant. The Caravello art collection consisted entirely of hitherto unknown masterpieces by the greatest artists, and it was celebrated throughout Europe, yet no-one could ever understand how he could have afforded the cost of building it. The connection with Sara and her family could suggest a different explanation: the entire collection may have been forged. Before we discovered her remarkable talent it would not have been possible to believe that any one person could master the styles of so many of the great artists, and a conspiracy of a number forgers to produce such a collection could never have been kept a secret for so long. We do not yet know which member of the remarkable Ghetto family is responsible, and my desire to meet this young woman is increased by my need to find out. I am reluctant to use our more potent methods of persuasion lest we destroy her precious gift, so our agents are watching the boats carefully to try to discover who else she may be working with. We dare not approach the family of the gondolier in case she runs again, but once we have access to someone she cares about, it will be easy to use her empathy to our own advantage. I will inform you the moment we have the girl under control.

Heil Hitler
