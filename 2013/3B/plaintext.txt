when i arrived the studio was already stocked with paints and canvas but
the professor helped me explain to daniel that the forgeries would be
quickly detected if we used them she was painted on a poplar board rather
than a stretched canvas and the pigments used by the master were very
different from the ones we use today now they bring me the pigments i ask
for soft chalky blood red sanguine and mustard yellow ochres from the
soils of italy i mix them with linseed oil boiled and aged in a kettle
properly prepared these paints are indistinguishable from the ones used
on the original and the copy is more likely to be betrayed by a careless
brush stroke or a misplaced highlight

the professor sees quickly when my tired eyes have missed at one and i
have made enough deliberate mistakes to convince them to move my studio
to the attic where the light is better from there i have a view of the
city and a reminder of freedom they still insist that i sleep here in
the cellar but that gives me another freedom the flickering candles cast
deep shadows which hide my other work if i cannot be free perhaps she can
