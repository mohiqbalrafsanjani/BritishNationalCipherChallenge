i was nearly caught last night he came to check on me and i just had time
to turn the canvas against the wall in the shadows i am not sure what he
saw but i kept my hands behind my back to hide the red pigment i had been
working and he said nothing he seems to have softened but i know i cannot
trust anyone here she must not be discovered here or they will take away
my last hope of rescuing her and returning her to the ghetto

my plans to escape are of less importance but my travel documents are now
complete the papers and inks were hard to acquire but i excused much of it
by explaining that i needed to sketch to sharpen my skills which had
deteriorated in the camp i am saving such food as might last mostly hard
bread and hard cheese against the days when i hope to run from this place
now i will need to find a way to steal money to pay for my journey my place
high in the attic gives me a view of the city which has allowed me to make
a map to guide me on the moonless night when i will finally run and i keep
the map with her and with this diary under the boards

i will live and i will be free and so will she
