this is the last of sarah's diary entries and it is a tough one to decrypt
i haven't had to decrypt a vigenere for a while and i almost didn't get
this one at least it tells us that she got away but beyond that i am not
sure what happened where did she go did the painting go with her and if
it did how come it is now back in the louvre did daniel or the ss officer
follow her who was he did he find her the trail is going cold and we need
a new idea

i was wondering if there might be something in the ss angle those guys
were nothing if not thorough do you have access to any ss papers from
that part of paris in the war maybe they knew what was going on

i am heading down to talk to alfredo geri he was the dealer peruggia
showed the mona lisa to back in maybe he knows something about sara's
family it's a long shot but unless you come up with something from the
nazi war record it is all we have

any news on the x-ray?
