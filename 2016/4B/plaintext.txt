the temp bank is pretty full and i think we have a real chance of building
a system that could actually prevent some of the attacks. the key is to
harvest the right intelligence at the right time and flag it for action
before it is too late. i think we can really help. the agencies could be
swamped with false alerts, so our filtering algorithm has to be really
smart, but then that is what we are good at, right? the test data pds
provided is amazingly detailed and makes it much easier to see the patterns.
i don't know how they could have got so much information about people. are
they storing everything people do online?

i never thought when i set out on a phd in mathematical physics that it
could lead to something with such immediate impact. i still love cosmology,
but there is a real buzz applying what we learned out here at dynamix, and
i can't believe how lucky i am to have this opportunity.

meeting with someone from citadelle this afternoon. i will tell you more
later. looking forward to seeing you again soon.
