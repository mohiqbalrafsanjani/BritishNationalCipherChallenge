OFFICIAL CLUE: This message has been encoded using a transposition cipher (you should note that the frequency analysis for the cipher is very similar to that of the English language), so the letters have been jumbled up instead of replaced. This one is a fairly simple column transposition and you can read about them in the beginner's guide to codebreaking on the resources page. Also, the same trick has been used by Martin as Jamelia used in her note in Challenge 1B - looks like they were used to sending one another notes secured like that.
