ANOTHER CLUE, more to follow: Once you have done a frequency analysis compare it to a frequency analysis for the English language, you should notice something very, very important here. Then look at the beginners guide to code breaking, and see if you can figure out what kind of cipher it is (it is different to all the ones in this challenge so far). You should then easily be able to find the letter x & hopefully that whole word.
