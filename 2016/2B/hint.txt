As usual Challenge 2B is more obscure than Challenge 2A, and you have less information to go on than you did for Challenge 1. On the other hand Jamelia has not been quite so devious in putting you off the scent this week. She must have thought her hiding place was secure enough. Frequency analysis is still your friend, but you will probably need to use it to help you find more than just the letter e this week. You can find out how to use cribs to help you, and discover more about some of the elementary ciphers in our Beginner's Guide to Codebreaking which you can download. Best of luck, Harry
