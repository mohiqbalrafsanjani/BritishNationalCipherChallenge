Challenge A is trickier this time as it isn't enough to work out just one or two letters to crack the cipher, but patience, frequency analysis and cribs will help. Challenge B is even tougher as you don't have the word structure to help guide you, but the same techniques work, you just need even more patience! For this round we will delay feedback on your answers until after the next points boundary, but if you are not sure you got it right there is nothing to stop you submitting again before then.
