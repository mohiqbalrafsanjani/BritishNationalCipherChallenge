notes on dynamix, citadelle, the pds syndicate:

dynamix are a small company that relies on post-graduate interns
for most of its good ideas. the project we worked on for dynamix
was signal recognition in a noisy environment.

citadelle is a major arms manufacturer that got left behind in the
digital age and seems to be looking to buy its way back into the
market by taking over smaller, more nimble competitors.

After we left dynamix, we were both approached by someone claiming
to work for citadelle, saying they were impressed by the work we
did there, and that they would be interested in developing the code
we wrote. I told them where to go. I thought martin was going to do
the same, but then he told me he wanted to talk with them. he said
that our code might be of interest to powerful people, and i thought
he was trying to get me to join him and work with them. now i think
he was trying to warn me. after martin disappeared i was approached
by someone claiming to work for a government agency known as the pds
syndicate. they wouldn't tell me what they did or why they were
interested, but they wanted to know where martin had gone.

i have almost finished testing the latest version of the net. it is
better than any of the previous versions by several orders of magnitude,
and i haven't tuned it yet. i think it has real potential, and i think
that dynamix, citadelle, and the pds syndicate think that, too. i am
afraid. i think i need to hide. i don't know where to run.
