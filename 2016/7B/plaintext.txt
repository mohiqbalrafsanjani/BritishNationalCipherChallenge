MARTIN,

WE HAVE MADE A DREADFUL MISTAKE AND I HAVE BEEN TOO SLOW TO ADMIT THAT TO MYSELF. I HAVE HAD A VISIT FROM THE WOMAN FROM THE SYNDICATE AND I CONFRONTED HER ABOUT THE SOURCE OF THE TEMPLATES. SHE CONFIRMED MY WORST FEARS AND NOW I WANT TO CRAWL AWAY AND DIE. WHAT HAVE WE DONE? OUR SOFTWARE HAS LED TO SO MUCH SUFFERING WHEN IT WAS DESIGNED TO DO THE OPPOSITE.

I ASKED HER HOW THE CABINET OFFICE COULD POSSIBLY HAVE AUTHORISED THIS AND SHE LAUGHED AND EXPLAINED THAT THE SYNDICATE NO LONGER WORKED FOR THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT. “CALL IT PRIVATE ENTERPRISE.” SHE SAID. “WE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN GOOD AT THAT”.

MY HORROR MUST HAVE BEEN WRITTEN ALL OVER MY FACE. SHE DIDN’T SEEM SURPRISED AT MY REACTION, BUT EQUALLY SHE DIDN’T TAKE IT WELL AND CIVILITY WAS ABANDONED. I ASKED HER HOW IT COULD BE LEGAL, LET ALONE MORAL, TO DO WHAT THEY PROPOSED, AND HER ANSWER WAS THAT IT WAS “NECESSARY”. I SAID WE WOULDN’T HELP THEM, AND SHE SAID IT WAS “NECESSARY” THAT WE DID. I SAID I WOULDN’T BE ABLE TO FACE MY FAMILY AND FRIENDS IF WE COOPERATED AND SHE SAID I WOULDN’T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THAT FOR LONG, ONE WAY OR ANOTHER THE PDS SYNDICATE WERE GOING TO MAKE SURE WE BOTH DISAPPEARED. LOOKING BACK I CAN SEE THAT FROM THE START THIS WHOLE THING HAS ACTED TO DRAW US IN TO ITS CENTRE AND NOW I AM AT THE EVENT HORIZON ALMOST UNABLE TO ESCAPE ITS PULL. BUT I THINK WE HAVE ONE LAST CHANCE.

I AM SURE SHE WILL BE VISITING YOU AS WELL. SHE THINKS WE HAVE NO CHOICE, BUT I THINK A CHOICE IS ALL WE HAVE. WHATEVER YOU DO HOLD OUT FOR BETTER TERMS. SHE HAS TO BELIEVE THAT YOU ARE ONSIDE AND MOTIVATED BY GREED SO THAT SHE WON’T WORRY ABOUT ANY QUALMS YOU MIGHT HAVE. CONVINCE HER THAT YOU WILL CONVINCE ME TO COOPERATE. TELL HER THAT YOU THINK YOU SHOULD WORK FROM THE COLLECTIVE IN OSLO AND THAT YOU WANT PAYMENT VIA THE BANK IN SWITZERLAND. I GOT THE IMPRESSION THAT MONEY IS NOT A PROBLEM. WITH MONEY IN A SWISS BANK AND THE EXPERTISE AND CONNECTIVITY AFFORDED BY THE COLLECTIVE I THINK WE HAVE A CHANCE TO ESCAPE AND TO TRY TO STOP THEM. PERHAPS WE WILL SURVIVE THIS. PERHAPS WE CAN BRING THEM DOWN.
