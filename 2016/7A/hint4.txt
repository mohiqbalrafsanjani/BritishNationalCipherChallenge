OFFICIAL CLUE: From the ioc's you should have noticed that the keyword is 7 letters long. Write out the cipher text in 7 columns. You know each column has been coded with a caesar shift. So on each column perform a frequency analysis and try to figure out the shift. You may end up with a couple of possible shifts, so note them both down and then check with the other columns to make sure it decodes to make proper words! After you have worked out a few of the shifts you may be able to guess the others by looking for cribs too. Remember, there is a twist too. So if at first you don't succeed look back at previous challenges for a hint.
