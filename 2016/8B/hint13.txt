OFFICIAL CLUE: Keyword is used to shuffle the letters of the alphabet, like in a mono alphabetic keyword cipher. Then use the binary to write out each letter, but in columns. So the word  and  would be:
A n d
0 0 0 2
0 1 0 2
0 1 1 2
0 1 0 2
1 1 0 2

Then it would be read off in rows as 00020102011201021102.

But just to complicate things, the binary was written in reverse, bottom to top, and a keyword of dynamix was used to shuffle the letters.
