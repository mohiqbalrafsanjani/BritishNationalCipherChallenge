Unless you are really confident that you know what you are doing, it is always worth cracking Challenge A before you start on Challenge B. Challenge A is where Harry communicates with his team and it will often contain some crucial information about what to expect in Challenge B. Feedback is now switched on so you will be able to see if you have made a mistake and correct it. Once you have submitted a correct answer don't try again, as we are only storing and scoring your most recent answer for Challenges 1A and 1B. Good luck! Harry

UPDATE Monday 17th October: Please do read what you are told about Challenge 1B in Challenge 1A. The hint is right at the beginning of the message and tells you how 1B has been encrypted. Take the hint at face value. If that is how it has been encrypted, which one of the possible encryptions has been used? Look for three letter words like "the" and "and" and use them as cribs. Best of luck, Harry
