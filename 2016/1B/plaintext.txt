I can't believe he left like that. After everything we said, after everything
we agreed. But he has gone, and I can't find him, and this is too big to deal
with alone. I can't blame him more than me, we were both blind to what was
happening and we are both guilty, but together we might have started to fix it.
I can't see how I can do that alone, here, now. So I don't have an option. It
has to end. I have to end it.
