jamelia,

what do you think about this? do you think dynamix would fund it?

proposal: long-baseline signal/noise analysis in large-scale
          heterogeneous networks
m. traynor and j. dalmar
abstract
in our work on signal/noise analysis for LIGO, we have developed new
tools for digital analysis of extremely low amplitude signals in an
excessively noisy environment. the classical features of this analysis
are the exploitation of very long baseline signal collection and the
synthesis of signals from a large sensor network. to filter the noise,
the principle novel feature is the development of a large database of
templates of target signals that allow them to be filtered from the
noise and interpreted in real time. we believe this approach can be
adapted to a wide variety of signal-harvesting problems, both within and
outside the physical sciences. as an example of a commercial application
of the technology, we have carried out analysis of a toy model which
suggests that this approach may be sensitive enough to track individual
footfall across a shopping centre or airport concourse, and to carry out
gait analysis using seismometers embedded in the building fabric. this
would provide a new and less obtrusive alternative to the camera systems
currently in use. it has not escaped our attention that the template-bank
approach should scale to allow tracking of multiple targets and to search
for patterns that may signal antisocial or potentially even terrorist
behaviour patterns. more speculatively, the long baseline techniques
which are key to triangulating the source of gravitational waves could
be modified to provide a template-based network analysis tool for finding
long-range correlations in network traffic. this analysis could signal
activity spikes among transnational criminal or terrorist groups, triggering
surveillance and targeting early intervention to prevent crime.
