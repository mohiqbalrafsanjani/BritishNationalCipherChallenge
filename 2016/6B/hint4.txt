Fourth clue: You should have worked out from the ioc's that the length of the keyword is 7. So, now write out the cipher text in 7 columns. You know each column has been coded with a caesar shift. So on each column perform a frequency analysis and try to figure out the shift. You may end up with a couple of possible shifts, so note them both down and then check with the other columns to make sure it decodes to make proper words! After you have worked out a few of the shifts you may be able to guess the others by looking for cribs too. Good luck.
