Harry, thanks for your note. Die alchemisten must have been pretty sure their
communications were secret or they wouldn't have used such an easy cipher. We
may have to use more serious ciphers in the future. I don't have the resources
for anything too fancy, since everyone is busy decrypting stuff from the
Pacific, so keep it simple. I have done some background digging with a contact
codenamed Aga from British intelligence. I enclose a telegram I received last
night from London. I wondered if you as a fellow academic could contact
Einstein or Teller directly to ask one of them what is going on. Our security
agencies are keeping very quiet about all this, which either means they don't
know about it, or that something big is happening. I know what you mean about
the Hindenburg. It does seem suspicious, but the accident investigators are
pretty sure that the explosion really was caused by the storm. Seems like when
the anchor cables hit the ground the static ignited the envelope which was
impregnated with some aluminum compound. I'm told that the hydrogen would have
burned hot but not for long. That stuff explodes up and away from the canopy,
which carried on burning for ten hours. Anyway, if there was foul play it
wasn't Aga's style.
