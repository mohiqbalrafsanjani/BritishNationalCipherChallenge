harry,

aga is not a guy. she is an agent of british intelligence and has been
working with me on the case for some time. her field of expertise is
actually the middle east. you know her better as agatha highfield. as
an archaeologist in egypt, she acquired an interesting list of german
contacts, not all of whom are friends with the german authorities. she
is a pretty sharp cookie, has charm, and is not averse to a little
blackmail.

she tells me you were trying to track her down a while back, but i guess
you were fooled like everyone else by the story about the titanic. turns
out that her party never made it to the ship; they got held up by a goods
train blocking the path to the dock. in any case, since she was trying
to shake off a tail at the time, she stayed under cover for a while and
was picked up by a british agent trying to leave the country with false
papers. they were impressed by her initiative, recruited her, and the
rest is history.

the babylon stone really did go down with the ship, she tells me, though
you never can tell with field agents. in any case, she is a useful broad
to have on board. i will get her to contact you directly.
