My dear professor Vandiver,

I do regret not contacting you at an earlier date. I heard about my
niece hiring you to investigate my disappearance, but the growing
threat of war and my role as an undercover operative in Europe
precluded me from getting in touch sooner.

How strange that our paths should cross like this again? My own
investigations into die Alchemisten lead me to the same conclusion
as you: The main danger has been for some time that the German
military would gain access to a supply of heavy water. However, our
allies in France have done much to forestall the threat. The story of
how we acquired it from the French is outlined below by agent Allier,
in a somewhat unusual version of a rather more secure French cipher.
You may need to reflect upon this in order to decipher my meaning, and
that of M. Allier, but for now rest assured that the current stock of
high-concentration heavy water is under heavy guard in the UK.
