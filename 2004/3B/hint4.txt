Another hint for 3B

If you are having trouble shuffling columns of text around can I suggest typing the text into cells in an Excel spreadsheet nine across like this

H E R E I S A T E
S T P I E C E O F
T E X T

then rearrange the columns by cutting and pasting then copying the text into notepad. Hope this helps anyone who has nearly got it. All the best,
