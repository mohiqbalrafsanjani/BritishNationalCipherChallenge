My Dear Professor Vandiver,

Even if the Nazis do not develop a weapon before we do, there remains
the strong possibility that they will develop the technology to use
nuclear fission as an energy source. Lise Meitner and her nephew Otto
Frisch have predicted that the energy release from the fission of a
uranium nucleus would be over 10 million times larger than that available
from a typical chemical reaction. Work of Hahn and Strassman suggests
that the fission process could release secondary neutrons moving at high
speeds. These neutrons are unlikely to interact with other nuclei. However,
if they can be slowed down sufficiently, then the reaction would be self-
sustaining. Prof. Fermi and my friend Leo Szilard are working on the use
of a pure form of graphite as the moderating agent. Prof. Bothe in Germany
has experimented with graphite and concluded that it won't work, though.
Prof. Szilard thinks there is an impurity in the graphite, boron, which
absorbs too many of the slow neutrons. Together with Fermi he is working
on obtaining a supply of pure graphite. Because of Bothe's results, die
alchemisten are almost certainly concentrating on the use of deuterium.
I did hear that Heisenberg's calculations show the need for a mass of
around thirteen thousand kilograms of the isotope uranium two three five
in order to initiate and sustain the runaway reaction needed to make a bomb,
so we may be worrying unnecessarily about the dangers there. However, I am
told that Oppenheimer has already outlined the design of a practical device
using uranium deuteride.
