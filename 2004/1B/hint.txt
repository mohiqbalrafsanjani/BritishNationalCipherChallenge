First Hint for Challenge 1

New to cipher cracking? If you don't know where to begin you could try looking at our notes on cracking subsitution ciphers which you will find in the Teachers' Pack

The best way to tackle a ciphertext like those in Challenge 1 is probably to use frequency analysis. This is a fancy way of saying that you should count up the letters in the text to figure out which appear most often. Since E and S are usually the most common letters in a plain English text it is almost certain that the most common letter in the ciphertext represents E.

You can also use the fact that these messages seem to have been encrypted with the word structure intact to try and identify common words like "the" and "a".

Good luck,
