My Dear Friend,

It appears that the scepticism of the old school concerning Bohr's model
of the nucleus may give us an opportunity to outflank our enemies. While
it remains only a possibility, it appears that the compound nucleus may
decay into other elements, giving life to the ancient dream of the alchemists.
The British admiralty papers must reach the Fuhrer without delay. It appears
that great power may be unleashed by the process of transmutation, and if
anyone is to discover its secret it must be for the glory of the Reich.
Foreign agents may be watching us, so we must be cautious. On no account must
this letter fall into enemy hands. You must return to Berlin without delay.
I suggest you travel back with the messenger on our great and faithful airship
the Hindenburg.
