Phil, I wrote to Einstein and have enclosed an extract from his reply.
Given the need for secrecy, I have used a muddled transcription to
encipher the message. The bottom line seems to be that if the Nazis
can build a bomb or even crack the problem of power generation, then
we have a huge problem. The export ban on helium may have made life
difficult for the airship companies, but maybe we should be focusing
on graphite and deuterium. I asked around, and have been told by the
chemists here that the key ingredients in the manufacture of deuterium
are large quantities of electricity and water. I figure we can't block
Nazi access to water, but how are they fixed for electricity? With the
Rhineland working flat out to stock the war machine, I can't believe
they would have the spare capacity to waste on a pretty speculative
project. On the other hand, the story about Heisenberg may be misinformation.
Maybe the Nazis know something we don't, and this is more than a punt.
Heisenberg is a talented theoretician, but those guys can make false
assumptions, and there are plenty of talented experimental physicists
over there. I am inclined to believe the story about Oppenheimer, in which
case the Nazis may have a design in mind themselves.
