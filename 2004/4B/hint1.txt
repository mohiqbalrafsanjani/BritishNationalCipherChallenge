Hint for Challenge 4

If you haven't tried frequency analysis yet on Challenge 4, now might be a good time to try it. Look at the documents too, who has sent them, who do you think they sent them to? Does that help you guess any of the words? Are there any words you expect to see in the text that might help as you decrypt?

More hints as time goes by. No need to panic, you have two weeks!
