It appears that Heisenberg's calculation of the need for thirteen
thousand kilograms may be wildly inaccurate. That traitor to the
fatherland, Otto Frisch, has written to the UK military establishment
with his own estimate of the quantities of the uranium isotope
required to sustain a nuclear explosion. His estimate, ten kilograms,
was at first ridiculed by our own team of theoreticians. However,
Frisch is, despite his treachery, a talented experimenter, and we
should not dismiss his estimate lightly. A crucial ingredient in the
new calculations is the use of a so-called moderator, and I am informed
that the candidates include heavy water. Our own scientists have worked
with the Norwegians on the production of this material, and Die
Alchemisten believe that acquisition of the source should be a prime
military objective. As soon as possible, we should make it possible for
a senior scientist to visit Copenhagen to discuss these matters with
Bohr. The Fuhrer must also be kept informed of this most vital project.
