Final Hint for 8B

Here we are at the end of the Challenge. Below you will find the next three cards in the Solitaire deck (you can work out what the last one for yourself!)

5,11,12

Come back later to find out the keyphrase for keying the deck!

With just a few hours to go before the final deadline, can I take the opportunity to say congratulations to all of you, and a big thank you for all your efforts. As I remarked somewhere else we have already started work on next year's Challenge and I hope you will come back then.

The final leader board positions will be published in the next few days and winners will be announced here some time in the next two weeks. We will be contacting some of you over the next few days to ask you to submit your computer code for consideration for the IBM Prize. Please don't send it to us unless we ask! Thanks.

We will keep the site live for a while, then archive it at www.maths.soton.ac.uk/cipher2004.

All the best,
