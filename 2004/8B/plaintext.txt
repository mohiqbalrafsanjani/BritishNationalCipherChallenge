My dear P and H,

For some time now, Dr. Jomar Brun and Einnar Skinnerland, the chief
engineer and designer of the Norsk Hydro in Vemork, have acted as
SOE agents, guiding us in our plans for the destruction of the plant.
Together they smuggled information out of the plant in toothpaste
tubes. It was sent to intelligence headquarters in London where our
cryptographer Leo Marks was able to decode the information for the
war cabinet.

I have been working with the resistance in the county of Telemark,
developing plans to launch a strike against the plant in October.
The advance party were landed on the Hardanger Plateau to carry
out a full reconnaissance. This team of four Norwegian SOE commandos
was code-named GROUSE and led by Lieutenant Jens Anton Poulssen.
Our initial assault on the plant, code-named Operation Freshman,
failed. Thirty-four royal engineers of the First British Airborne
Division, together with the crews of two gliders and one bomber
died when their aircraft crashed into mountains as a result of poor
visibility. The survivors met a terrible end at the hands of their
captors. Brun has advised us that the destruction of the Vemork
plant will have much more chance of success if the assault is made
on a smaller scale. One of the most highly trained and respected
Norwegian lieutenants, Joachim Ronnenberg, has been chosen to lead
the attack with a group known as Gunnerside. They face almost certain
death and I will stay here to support them.

Good luck and godspeed in all that you do. Perhaps we will meet one
day when all this is over.

Yours ever,

Agatha Highfield
