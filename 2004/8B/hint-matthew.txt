Hint for 8B

Good hint from Matthew in the comments. Take a look if you need to get started cracking by hand. Don't forget to take a break some time over the holiday, though! All the best,

If my data is correct, there are four different key configurations that give a coherent message over the first 36 characters (which is, in fact, the correct start of the message). Given that you say 36 and not a slightly higher number, I suspect that you've got one of the wrong ones, but even the right one gets hard to read around this patch.

Like the Wombats suggest, you should go through the first 60-65 characters before you utterly reject a trial, especially if you can awkwardly pronounce the plaintext stream you're generating.
