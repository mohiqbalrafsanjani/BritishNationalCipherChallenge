Hint for Challenge 7A

No wonder you are finding it difficult, it has been double encrypted by that cunning Aunt Aggie. She encrypted the plain text using a polyalphabetic substitution cipher then rearranged the ciphertext letters using some rule. I guess that's what she meant about "reflecting". I guess the layout of the message wasn't incidental.

Good luck,
