my dear p and h,

the news about the fall of norway confirms our worst fears the nazis
have not yet taken control of rjukan since the region around telemark
is still resisting strongly i have spoken with contacts in the exiled
norwegian government here in london they gave a resolute answer of no
to the nazi demand for submission and it is believed that popular
resistance to the occupiers has been bolstered by the strength of
purpose shown by the parliament when it authorised the establishment
of a government in exile

it will be a while before serious operations can recommence in norway
but not all forces have been destroyed and some have regrouped in
scotland for further training with the commandos

i will be travelling there myself shortly and you will not hear from
me for some time i can only ask you to be patient and to believe that
all is not lost

i enclose a message intercepted by a listening post in the narvik region
the german field police seem to have abandoned their traditional use of
a double transposition cipher in favour of the less secure double
playfair other transmissions from this source have ended with the words
"message ends" he or she also always uses the keyword "anschluss" in one
of the squares and either "lebensraum" or "fatherland" in the other and
sets the period of the cipher to seven

the next message you receive from me will be enciphered using an
ingenious method taught to me by the american agent schneier he termed
it the solitaire cipher though i think we might call it the patience
cipher here certainly it requires patience using only a deck of cards
one can encrypt even the longest messages with the most remarkable
security to decipher my message you will need a pack of playing cards
and a key which i will send by another route might i also suggest that
in your further communications you follow my example as this awful war
unfolds the need for secrecy becomes ever greater

yours
agatha highfield
