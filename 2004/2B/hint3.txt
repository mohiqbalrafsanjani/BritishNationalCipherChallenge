Hint for 2B

OK, if you've been watching the comments on this site you'll have seen several people suggest that you should think about the clues you have. Challenge 2B is a telegram. Messages in telegrams were often punctuated using the word STOP in place of the fullstop. So maybe you can find that word srpinkled through the message and maybe, just maybe, that is enough of a crib to crack the rest of the cipher. Hope so. Maybe another hint tomorrow. Just maybe. Sleep well,
