Hint for 2B

I keep getting asked for a hint for 2B, but it is way too early for that, we have a whole week! Here's a little one:

The two most common letters in English text are E and S (WHOOPS - sorry about the typo, I meant) T. Depending on the text either could occur most often.

Another hint tomorrow ...
