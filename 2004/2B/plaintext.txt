My Dear P,

Szilard filed patents on the production of energy from fission of the
nucleus stop He was sufficiently worried about the possibility of
creating a weapon from this technology that he has transferred the
patents to the office of the Navy stop The goal of the alchemists
could be grander than the vision of Newton, Flamel, and their other
predecessors stop The technology required to initiate or sustain
such a reaction is not yet known to us stop It appears that AE and ET
have written to Roosevelt outlining the possibilities of such a
project so you can check this with them stop In the meantime, we must
assume the worst stop
