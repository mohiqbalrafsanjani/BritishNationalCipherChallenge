harry,

it has been a while. things have been busy here with the declaration of
war last december. they have moved most of us from the bureau to a new
outfit called OSS, though the various military intelligence outfits still
seem to be more interested in fighting territorial battles with us than
with the enemy. maybe to them we are the enemy.

mostly i've been working on intelligence from the pacific. maybe we should
have been paying more attention to what it was telling us before. people
aren't saying anything about the fission thing, but you'll be pleased to
hear that i got a message from aga. i haven't had time to read it myself,
since it has been encrypted using the patience cipher. let's hope it is
good news. you may have forgotten the key we agreed with aga, so i enclose
a reminder for some of it. you'll have to work out the rest yourself, for
obvious security reasons.

i guess we won't be seeing much of one another till this is all over, but
i just wanted to say thanks for all your help. bye for now.

phil
