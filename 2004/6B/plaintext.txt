In March, nineteen forty the Deuxi√®me Bureau acquired the existing
one hundred eighty-five kilograms of heavy water from Vemork. Since
I was being followed, I took the precaution of booking myself and
the precious cargo onto flights to Scotland and to Amsterdam. It
appears to have been a wise precaution, since the Amsterdam flight
was forced to land in Hamburg, where it was thoroughly examined by
SS officers. Meanwhile, I traveled with the cans of heavy water to
our military mission in London, and from there to the College de
France. With German soldiers approaching Paris, the French physicist
Joliot took the cargo to Mont Dore, the spa in central France, from
where it was moved to Bordeaux for evacuation. When the harbour was
bombed, the ship sailed down the Gironde estuary amid chaos. The ship
next to her was sunk by a mine, and when questioned about the heavy
water, Joliot said it was on the sunken ship, misleading the Nazi agents.
It has now been deposited in Wormwood Scrubs prison, a most secure
location, I am sure you will agree. Now our attention must turn to
the security of the Vemork facility. Joliot has remained in France
and will act as an officer of the resistance. Given the precarious
position of Norway, it can only be a matter of time before this
production facility falls into Nazi hands. This prospect we must avoid.
