Phil, the attached message is pretty easy to crack, though the contents are
very alarming on two levels. First I figure the Nazis are up to something pretty
weird. The guys over in the physics department have been pretty worked up about
this nuclear stuff and I have heard nasty rumours circulating about some guy
Szilard over in England. Second it seems more than coincidental that this
particular flight went down in flames. There are a lot of people who would want
this sort of message stopped or intercepted and I'm surprised and worried that
the feds aren't involved. Is someone else operating on your turf? Harry.
