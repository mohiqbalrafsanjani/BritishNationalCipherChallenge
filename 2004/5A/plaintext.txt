Phil,

I did a little more digging, and it seems like the first customers of our
friends in Rjukan were at Birkbeck College, London, England, so perhaps
Aga could make contact with Norsk Hydro that way. Looking at the situation,
it may be our best bet. According to a friend in the State Department,
Norway is sticking firmly to her neutrality in the face of an imminent
invasion. You may need to use informal channels, if you want to convince
the Norwegians to shut down the plant.

Future communications need to be more secure, so can you get me a direct
line to Aga? As a rule, we shouldn't use the same cipher more than twice.
Initially I was going to suggest a new method of encryption for your reply,
but I'll leave that for you to figure out.

Regards to your family,
Harry
