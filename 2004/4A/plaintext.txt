Harry, our friend Aga has forwarded the attached intercept to me.
Their cipher guys believe it to be encrypted using a keyword cipher.
Could you take a crack at it for me?

I asked around and deuterium seems to be the stuff known as heavy
water. The Norwegians make this in large quantities at the Norsk
hydroelectric plant at Vemork near Rjukan up until nineteen thirty-four.
The plant was used to produce ammonia for the fertilizer and the
explosives industries, but it was converted to produce heavy water by
Jomar Brun, the head of hydrogen research at Norsk Hydro, in collaboration
with Karl Friedrich Bonhoffer, a German physical chemist at Leipzig. The
risks are obvious. I think it won't be long before die alchemisten decide
they need access to Vemork.
