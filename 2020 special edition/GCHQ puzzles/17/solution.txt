The answer this week is provided by Kfford-Academy:

T, T, W. This is very much like Challenge 16, with the four disciples Matthew, Mark, Luke and John. Here is how to get the sequence:

Step 1 – Reorder the letters of each term in alphabetical order:
matthew -> aehmttw
mark -> akmr
luke -> eklu
john -> hjno

Step 2 – Put these new terms into a grid, as follows:
aehmttw, akmr, eklu, hjno
|
v
aehmttw
akmr
eklu
hjno

Step 3 – Read off the columns:
aehmttw
akmr
eklu
hjno
|
v
aaeh, ekkj, hmln, mruo, t, t, w
