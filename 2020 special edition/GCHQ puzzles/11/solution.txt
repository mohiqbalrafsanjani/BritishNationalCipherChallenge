1. This country (LAOS) is an anagram (ALSO) of a synonym (TOO) of a homophone of a prime number TWO) and a homophone (LOUSE) of an anagram of a capital city (SEOUL).
2. This ex Prime Minister's surname (CAMERON) is an anagram (ROMANCE) of a synonym (LOVE) of an anagram of a rodent (VOLE).
3. This emotion (FEAR) is an anagram (FARE) of a homophone (FAIR) of an antonym (FOUL) of a homophone (FOWL) of an anagram of a canine animal (WOLF) that is a synonym (EAT) of an anagram (ATE) of a homophone of a single digit number (EIGHT).

Bonus marks for inventiveness and for passion!
