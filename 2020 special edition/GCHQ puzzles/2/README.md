    g. Two rival footballers, born on the same day but from very different backgrounds, battle for supremacy.

Wartime recruitment to the Government Codes and Cypher School was necessarily shrouded in mystery, but one of the stars of the show was the Times crossword. The "crypt" in cryptanalyst and cryptic crossword is not a coincidence and several of the codebreakers at Bletchley were recruited for their crossword speed. Here the devious minds at GCHQ Puzzle Central pose some devious cryptic clues to popular books (in some cases also films). Can you figure out each twist and name them? Some of them will be more familiar to older readers so we have colour coded them for difficulty.

Once you have solved any, post on the Forum saying which one and giving your answer. If it is right we will remove the answer and put up your post for the world to see.
