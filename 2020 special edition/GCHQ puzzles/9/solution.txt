The solution this week comes from the first person to crack it, Kford-Academy. Well done!

Divide the following names into two groups:

Ada, Diana, Egon, Flo, Ida, Kent, Nev, Wes

The one that can go into both groups is Ida. Here are the groups.

Group 1 (starting US states):
Flo (Florida)
Ida (Idaho)
Kent (Kentucky)
Nev (Nevada)
Wes (West Virginia)

Group 2 (ending US states):
Ada (Nevada)
Diana (Indiana)
Egon (Oregon)
Ida (Florida)
