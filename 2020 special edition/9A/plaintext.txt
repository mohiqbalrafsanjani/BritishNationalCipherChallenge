Harry, We received further encouraging reports from Swallow about the effects of the USAAF raid. The secondary targets of the attack were the station at Rjukan, the industrial tracks and the track to Vemork. While the railway tracks themselves remain operational, a considerable amount of rolling stock was seriously damaged, with two locomotives, eight cargo wagons and seven passenger wagons suffering damage. Our agents in the plant have confirmed that this has slowed the German plan to ship the remaining stocks of potassium peroxide to Die Alchemisten research facilities in Berlin. In preparation for the shipment, civilians are no longer allowed access to the railway and patrols have been stepped up. Security at all the railway stations has been significantly increased. Swallow have matched this by increasing their own surveillance on the Rjukan line and proposed a number of plans to intercept the shipment, but the enhanced security make it very unlikely that a standard sabotage would succeed in doing more than delaying the shipment. Alternatives including the local ferry routes are being actively considered. As with the air raid civilian casualties are a major consideration but the plant director, Bjarne Nilssen, is sympathetic and may be able to influence the date and time of shipment in order to reduce the risk. Once more, our agents have been successful in intercepting enemy communications concerning the mission, and the enclosed telegram summarising the plans confirms our own investigations. With this in hand I think the Swallow team will be able to execute a successful sabotage and hopefully terminate the German nuclear weapons program. Let's hope we can end this soon. Phil
