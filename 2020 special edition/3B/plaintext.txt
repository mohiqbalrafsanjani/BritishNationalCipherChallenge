Phil, I am heading to Sweden to speak with Lise Meitner. She was part of the team who split the atom and together with Frisch has worked out the details of how it works. She is a brilliant chemist as well as a physicist and I am hoping she can shed some light on how likely it is that that Die Alchemisten could develop a nuclear power generation system from the process.
On the way back, I plan to also visit some people I know in Norway. A new power source will be of no use to the Nazis without the raw materials for manufacturing, and a lot of the major bauxite smelters in Europe are based in the country. Even without a new source of power the German military planners will have their eye on supply lines and the Norwegian aluminium companies must be one of their prime targets. I thought I would drop in and try to get a sense of how well defended these places are. There may already have been approaches from Germany as part of their arms build-up and it would be good to know that too. If the worst happens and Norway is invaded, then I want to have some agents already embedded in the national infrastructure and we need to think about how we would secure communications in an occupied country. If you or the agency have any contacts there then let me know. With a little luck I may even get to see the Northern Lights while I am there.
