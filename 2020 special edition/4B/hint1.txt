Now the competition has started in earnest we thought you might like the occasional hint or tip, so here is something to help with Challenge 4.

The tech team have posted a frequency analysis app on the site at https://www.cipherchallenge.org/frequency-counter/ which you can use for any of the challenges. It won't always help much, but we think it might this week!

Good luck,

Harry
