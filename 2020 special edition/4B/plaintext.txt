First Meeting of Die Alchemisten Committee, Reichserziehungsministerium, Twenty Ninth April Nineteen Thirty Nine
The committee was reconvened by the Minister at the request of the Chancellor himself.
It is tasked with realising the military and industrial promise of nuclear energy.
The committee recognises the technical challenges involved in industrialising the processes hitherto conducted under laboratory conditions, but feels that the obstacles can be overcome by a combination of scientific and engineering excellence already possessed by the state.
The committee identified that the principle issue is that of controlling the nuclear reaction which is mediated by the energy of free neutrons. These need to be slowed to effectively harness their power, and to this end the committee recommends the acquisition of a suitable moderator.
The best-known candidate is deuterium and the best source of this material is the power plant at Vemork in Norway. The Tronstad and Brun electrolytic process at that facility is producing over twenty kilograms of heavy water per year, and this could easily be scaled up.
Since we do not want to alert our enemies to the importance of the material the committee recommends placing an initial order for five litres of heavy water through our own Dye Industry Syndicate Corporation which, by happy accident, owns a quarter of the shares in the Vemork plant.
