Harry, we managed to tap the phone lines in Oslo and intercepted German military police reports to the SS headquarters. They established that the Gunnerside operation was effective in wiping out the existing stocks of heavy water, but that the Nazi engineers were able to restart production. This was confirmed in communications smuggled out of the plant by Jomar Brun and Einnar Skinnerland, the Chief Engineer and designer of the plant, who are still working there as SOE agents. The information was sent to Intelligence Headquarters in London in toothpaste tubes using a cipher developed for BOSS by Leo Marks. This intelligence was passed to USAAF who started to develop a plan to bomb the plant, running the risk of significant civilian losses. Luckily one of our BOSS officials spotted the map on the wall of a briefing room during a protocol visit and realised what it was. He flagged the operation and got me involved. I was able to contact Swallow via the Oslo branch of Milorg and we have been working together with USAAF to refine the mission. Despite the risks they agreed to a daylight raid in the hope that the added accuracy would reduce Norwegian casualties. Unfortunately the raid was a mixed success as you can see from the attached report. It is double encrypted again, but was a lot tougher to crack. They have used an affine shift for the substitution phase, before using the same sort of transposition. Take a look and let me know what you think. Meanwhile, I will try to contact Ronnenberg to see what he wants to do next. Given the need to protect our network I will increase the key length for my message to you next week to at least six.
