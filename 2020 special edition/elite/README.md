CONGRATULATIONS

You have joined an elite band of cryptanalysts who have cracked the final round of a BOSS training mission. Or have you? Clearly the story can't end there, and if you want to read the final instalment before everyone else gets to, then you will have to crack one final code. You solved part of the puzzle by finding this page. Now you have to use all your skill to break the cipher protecting the attached report from Swallow, which details the final adventure. It is like nothing you have seen before in this edition of the competition, but I will tell you that it is inspired by the simple combination lock!

If you can't crack it don't worry, you did well to find this page. Let Harry know you got that far on the forum by posting the codeword ELITE. We will publish the solution here at the end of the competition

No feedback, no marks, no submission form -- no help from us at all. You are all alone! If you get the solution, email it to Harry. The first ten people/teams who crack it will be awarded the accolade of Cipher ELITE. Good luck!
