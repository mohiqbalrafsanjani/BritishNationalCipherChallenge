Harry, I guess you have heard by now about the invasion. It has come as no shock to anyone. The British had been openly discussing a counter manoeuvre, and that is now a significant part of the Nazi propaganda. The official line is the Wehrmacht are there to protect the country's neutrality against Franco-British aggression. The attached invasion orders were intercepted by BOSS agents in the capital who have established a headquarters next to the telephone exchange. As far as we can tell, their tap into the secure telegraphic system has not yet been detected, but we will need to look out for fake intelligence in case that changes. Unsurprisingly the orders use the most secure cipher we have seen yet: a columnar transposition. Luckily, I had some idea what to look for, since Norsk Hydro was an important target for the Reichserziehungsministerium, and that gave me a big clue. The message makes me very glad that Monsieur Allier was able to evacuate the heavy water. Now that the SS have taken control of Rjukan it is only a matter of time until they build up their own stocks, but that will take a while and we can use that period to work out what to do next. We will be relying heavily on your network in the country to feed us with intelligence on the factory, which is why I asked our communications team to set up this more secure channel. If we can break the telegraph system we should assume that the Nazis can too. I would like us to move to using Vigenere ciphers for our future messages. Stay safe. Phil
