WHILE THE USAAF BOMBING RAID IN NOVEMBER FAILED TO CAUSE MUCH DAMAGE TO THE HEAVY WATER PRODUCTION CAPACITY AT THE PLANT IT BECAME CLEAR TO THE NAZI OFFICIALS THAT THE FACTORY WAS NO LONGER SAFE DIE ALCHEMISTEN WERE INFORMED AND RULED THAT THE MODERATOR WOULD BE SAFER STORED IN GERMANY WHERE IT WOULD ALSO BE CLOSER TO THEIR EXPERIMENTAL FACILITIES

THE OPERATION TO MOVE THE REMAINING STOCKS OF POTASSIUM HYDROXIDE FROM WHICH THE HEAVY WATER WAS TO BE EXTRACTED WAS PLANNED FOR MIDFEBRUARY AND BOSS WAS ALERTED TO THE PLAN BY MEMBERS OF THE SWALLOW TEAM WHO REMAINED IN CONTACT WITH LOYAL NORWEGIANS WORKING AT THE PLANT THEIR INTEL ALLOWED A COUNTEROPERATION TO BE PREPARED

INITIAL SURVEILLANCE SHOWED THAT SECURITY ON THE RAIL LINE THAT WOULD CARRY THE CARGO HAD BEEN STEPPED UP FOLLOWING THE BOMBING RAIDS WITH LOCAL CIVILIANS NO LONGER ALLOWED TO TRAVEL ON THE TRAINS AND INCREASED GUARD PATROLS SABOTAGE OF THE RAILWAY LINE WAS NOT FEASIBLE AND IN ANY CASE IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO PLANT A CHARGE DISRUPTIVE ENOUGH TO DAMAGE THE CARGO

A DECISION WAS TAKEN INSTEAD TO MINE THE HULL OF THE SF HYDRO BOSS AGENTS IN THE PLANT WERE ABLE TO DETERMINE THE SHIPPING DATE AND IN ORDER TO MINIMIZE CIVILIAN CASUALTIES KJELL NIELSEN DELAYED THE DECANT OF THE POTASSIUM HYDROXIDE FROM THE STORAGE TANKS INITIALLY THE SS HAD HOPED TO SHIP ON THE SATURDAY WHEN THE FERRIES WERE TYPICALLY VERY BUSY THE DELAY MOVED THE SHIPMENT TO SUNDAY REDUCING THE NUMBER OF PASSENGERS

BY SINKING THE FERRY IN THE DEEPEST PART OF LAKE TINN THE SABOTEURS HOPE TO PREVENT THE NAZIS FROM RECOVERING THE CARGO EXPERIMENTS CONVINCED THEM THAT THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY TO ENSURE THAT THE FERRY COULD NOT BE RESCUED WAS TO BLOW OUT A SQUARE SECTION OF THE HULL BY THE PROW BY SINKING THE PROW FIRST THE SHIPS STEERAGE WOULD BE LIFTED OUT OF THE WATER LEAVING THE CREW WITH NO CONTROL THE TEAM WERE DETERMINED THAT WHILE THE EXPLOSION HAD TO BE LARGE ENOUGH TO CAUSE FATAL DAMAGE TO THE SHIP IT HAD TO LEAVE TIME FOR THE PASSENGERS AND CREW TO EVACUATE THEY BUILT THE BOMB FROM EIGHTEEN POUNDS OF PLASTIC INITIAL PLANS TO USE FUSES LEFT OVER FROM THE SUCCESSFUL VEMORK SABOTAGE OPERATION WERE TOO SHORT FOR THIS AS THE SHIP WOULD STILL BE CLOSE TO SHORE WHEN THE EXPLOSIVES WENT OFF SO THE TEAM IMPROVISED A TIMING DEVICE USING AN ALARM CLOCK THE SQUAD CONSISTING OF ALF LARSEN KNUT LIERHANSEN ROLF SORLIE AND KNUT HAUKELID ASSEMBLED A FEW KILOMETRES FROM THE QUAY AT MAEL AND APPROACHED AT NIGHT THEY CUT THROUGH A FENCE AND BOARDED THE SHIP WHERE THEY WERE DISCOVERED BY A PATROL LIERHANSEN TRIED TO CONVINCE THE GUARD THAT THEY WERE PASSENGERS WHO JUST WANTED TO SLEEP ON THE BOAT BUT HE WAS UNCONVINCED SENSING THAT THE HE MIGHT BE SYMPATHETIC THE TEAM ADMITTED THAT THEY WORKED FOR THE RESISTANCE AND TOLD THE GUARD THEY NEEDED TO BE ALLOWED TO HIDE SOMETHING ON THE SHIP THIS WORKED AND SORLIE AND HAUKELID WERE PERMITTED TO GO BELOW DECK TO THE KEEL WHERE THEY SPENT THE NEXT TWO HOURS PLACING EXPLOSIVES WHEN THEY HAD FINISHED THE SABOTEURS LEFT THE SHIP WITHOUT ANY FURTHER CHALLENGE

THE NEXT MORNING THE DEVICE EXPLODED AS PLANNED JUST AS THE LADEN SHIP REACHED THE URDALEN LIGHTHOUSE IT TURNED IMMEDIATELY FOR SHORE BUT THE DAMAGE WAS TOO SEVERE AND THE SHIP LISTED QUICKLY THE SHIP SANK AT TEN THIRTY SETTLING ON THE BOTTOM IN FOUR HUNDRED AND THIRTY METERS THE LIFEBOATS WERE NOT DEPLOYED AND PASSENGERS AND CREW HAD NO INSTRUCTIONS ON THE USE OF LIFEBELTS SO CASUALTIES WERE UNAVOIDABLE BUT FARMERS FROM ACROSS THE LAKE CAME TO THE RESCUE OF THE CREW AND PASSENGERS FOURTEEN NORWEGIAN CREW AND PASSENGERS AND FOUR GERMAN SOLDIERS DIED AND EIGHT DAYS AFTER THE INCIDENT PASSENGERS AND CREW OF THE SF RJUKANFOS MARKED THE SINKING WITH A MEMORIAL SERVICE

THE CASUALTIES WERE MOST REGRETTABLE BUT THEIR DEATHS WERE NOT IN VAIN THE CARGO WAS DESTROYED AND IT IS LIKELY THAT THIS WILL MARK AN END TO THE GERMAN NUCLEAR WEAPONS PROGRAMME
