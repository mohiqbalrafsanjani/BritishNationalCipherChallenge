The cipher first breaks each character (including spaces) into ternary digits.

_ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ

The least significant digit is shifted one character to the right, with
wrap-around (the digit that falls off the right end is put at the left).

Digits are then recombined into characters, with @ instead of space.
