Report on Operation Gunnerside from Swallow: After recovering supplies from the mission container drops Ronnenberg's team set out to join up with Swallow. The two teams met after several days of cross country skiing and the party made its way to Vemork. While patrols had reduced from the high frequency that the Wehrmacht established following Operation Freshman, the bridge spanning the ravine over the Mana remained fully guarded, and the commando group felt that a direct assault would be unproductive. It was decided that a team should descend two hundred meters into the ravine, ford the river below and climb the hill on the far side. On reaching the river bed it was found to be possible to follow a single-track goods railway into the plant and the entry was carried out without encountering any guards. The local BOSS agent in the plant supplied detailed plans and schedules and the raiding party used that to gain further access via a cable tunnel and window encountering only the caretaker, Johansen, who, as a patriotic Norwegian, was more than willing to cooperate. The sappers placed mines with timed fuses on the electrolysis chambers. As planned, they also left a Thompson submachine gun at the scene to prove that this was an attack by British forces. Hopefully that will prevent reprisals against the locals. The explosive charges detonated, destroying the electrolysis equipment and the adjacent storage chambers. The combined team will now split up into three groups. Team A is heading out to Sweden for exfiltration. Team B will head to Oslo to join up with Milorg. Team C will remain in place in the region pending further instructions.
