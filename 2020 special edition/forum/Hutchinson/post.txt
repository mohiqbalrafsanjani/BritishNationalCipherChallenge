TLW THE HUTCHINSON PROBLEM
==========================
You are to get a counter from the top left cell to the X at the lower right by
jumping the number of cells indicated by the cell the counter lands on.
Moves are orthogonal -- left-right-up-down within the grid (no wrap-around).
The first choice will be either 2R or 2D.

2 3 3 2 1 4
1 2 3 1 2 3
3 2 1 1 3 3
1 1 3 2 3 4
2 2 4 3 4 2
3 4 3 3 2 X

for any postings use the notation: 1R-2U-3L-4D... the digit being the one landed on and the letter the direction from it.

What is the fewest number of jumps required.
What is the most number of jumps that can be taken (without repeating a circle).
How many solutions can you find?

(I have no specific answers to give, your feedback will be welcome)
