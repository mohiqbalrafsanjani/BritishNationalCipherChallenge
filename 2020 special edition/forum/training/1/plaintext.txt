In cryptology, a code is a method used to encrypt a message that operates
at the level of meaning; that is, words or phrases are converted into
something else. A code might transform "change" into "CVGDK" or "cocktail
lounge". The U.S. National Security Agency defined a code as "A substitution
cryptosystem in which the plaintext elements are primarily words, phrases,
or sentences, and the code equivalents (called "code groups") typically
consist of letters or digits (or both) in otherwise meaningless combinations
of identical length." A codebook is needed to encrypt, and decrypt the
phrases or words. By contrast, ciphers encrypt messages at the level of
individual letters, or small groups of letters, or even, in modern ciphers,
individual bits. Messages can be transformed first by a code, and then by
a cipher. Such multiple encryption, or "superencryption" aims to make
cryptanalysis more difficult.

I stole this cipher from some punk high-schoolers from Palo Alto, California.
