TLW A MIND FOR STRENGTH
=======================
You have been locked up in a pitch dark secure room having one solid bolted door.
Your only means of escape is the four capsules in your pocket, two blue and two red.
They give you incredible strength when you take one red capsule with one blue capsule.
However, if you take two red capsules or two blue capsules you overdose and die.

Will you escape the room or will you die?
