TLW The 27 Tiles Problem
==========================
This Puzzle consists of 27 tiles.

[ 1 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 3 4 4 4 5 5 5 6 6 6 7 7 7 8 8 8 9 9 9 ] row 1
[ 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ] row 2

Row 1 has 3 tiles of each number 1 to 9. (The 0's in row 2 are just place holders.)
You are to arrange them into row 2 so that there are the same number of spaces
between two tiles of the same value and the space count is the value of the tile

e.g. 1*1*1 and 2**2**2

where the * is a space and will be filled with one of the other numbers.

There are 3 solutions (6 counting reversals).

Test yourself -- find all three. Good Luck and Enjoy.

Given your 3 answers in the form of a sum (answer + answer_reversed)

No answers for you Harry -- do not want to spoil it for you.
