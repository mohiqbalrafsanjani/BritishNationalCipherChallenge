YOU NEVER KNOW WHEN OR IF HARRY WILL AT SOME FUTURE TIME USE A QUAGMIRE FOUR CIPHER, SO HAVING SOLVED THIS PUTS YOU IN GOOD STEAD AND READYNESS SHOULD THE OCCASION ARISE.
I KNOW THAT THIS TEXT IS NOT REALLY LONG ENOUGH TO DO AN ANALYSIS ON TO TELL WHAT TYPE OF CIPHER IT MIGHT BE THAT IS WHY I GAVE YOU ALL THE CLUES TO IT IN CIPHER THREE -- QUEUE FOR (Q4) AND THE THREE KEYWORDS WERE GIVEN. I DID NOT INTEND YOU TO HAVE TO FIND THOSE BUT RATHER TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO SIMPLY SOLVE IT, WHICH YOU MUST HAVE DONE TO READ THIS, SO WELL DONE YOU!
IF YOU WANT TO POST TO PROVE THAT YOU HAVE SOLVED ALL THE CIPHERS PRINT THE LAST WORD FROM EACH OF THE THREE PRECEDING CIPHERS FOLLOWED BY A NUMBER BEING THE COUNT OF THE CHARACTERS IN YOUR USER NAME, FOR EXAMPLE 'TLW MINI WORD WORD WORD NINTEEN' WOULD BE SUBMITTED BY THE-LETTER-WRIGGLER.
