TLW The 10 Digit 'Tally Number' Continued
============================================
Well here is what I was going to put up but Madness has done it all for you!!
But see further below.

Uniqueness was proven in 1968 by Martin Gardner and Edward P DeLorenzo.
I do not have possession of these.

You are on your own with the following, don't ask me for answers or programs to use.

Things for you to do:

Solve for other bases 4, 5, 7, 8, 9 ... 36.

Note: No 'tally number' exists for bases 1,2,3 and 6.

There are 2 solutions for base 4 the only base to have 2
There is 1 unique solution for all other bases greater than six.

[0123] base 4
[dddd]
[dddd]

Can you find the general formular for all bases greater than six?
When you have done a few it may become obvious.

Daniel Shoham from MIT observed (in 1995) the R2 digits must add to 10 and derived a value for the maximum possible value for each digit in Row 2. His logic was, if digit x appears under digit y there must be x appearances of y, hence x * y < 10.

[0123456789] y
[9943211111] x (maximum y's)

More workings to keep you busy...

Mr Pickover being the innovator of many a math problem added to this.
=======================================================================
All below is in base 10 workings.

[0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9] row 1
[d d d d d d d d d d] row 2

Take the answer of row 2 as the start row and solve for that, that answer then becomes the start row and so on.
Can you find a row 3 or row 4?
If so what happens if you continue?

R1 = 0123456789
R2 =
R3 =
R4 =
R5 =
R6 =

Using any of the digits 0 to 9 in any order, repeats allowed, choose any starting 10 digit number of your choice and, working like above, what is the longest path you can obtain.

Note that there may be more than 1 solution at each step and that means you will have to choose the one that carries the path forward.

The longest path found (in 1995 by Tomas Oliveira e Silva from Portugal) goes to R9 before looping back to R7. He started with R1 = 0000122245

And his longest length -loop- found goes to R5 (and starts over from R1)
Started with R1 = 0000111244

Also his longest path not leading to a loop, but to a dead end, given here in full
R1 = 1223334444
R2 = 4223331111 (there are 42 other solutions to 1223334444)
R3 = 0332220000 (there are 4 other solutions to 4223331111)
R4 = 3550003333 (there are 2 other solutions to 0332220000)
R5 = 0555550000 (there is 1 other solution to 3550003333, leading to a loop)
R6 = No solution -- dead end

It is currenty (in 1995) not known if there are other paths of the same length.

If there are any other 'finds' or anything you else can add to this let us all know.
