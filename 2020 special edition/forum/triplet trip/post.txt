TLW TRIPLET TRIP
================
Starting at any position, you are required to traverse the whole grid.
The rule being that you choose three different letters then repeat them to make the trip.

A B C A C A
C A C B C B
B B A C A B
A C B B A C

Show your trip by use of matrix index inserting 01..24
00 00 00 00 00 00
00 00 00 00 00 00
00 00 00 00 00 00
00 00 00 00 00 00

I wonder, how many such trips are possible?

Re: TLW TRIPLET TRIP
Forgot to state:
Moves are orthogonal -- left-right-up-down within the grid (no wrap-around).
