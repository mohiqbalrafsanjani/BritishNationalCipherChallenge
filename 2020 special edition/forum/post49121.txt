TLW ANSWERS TO MY POST - PART 1
===============================

============================================ ANSWER
TLW CIPHER
==============================
Admittedly this seems a hard one to crack.

I came across a similar looking cipher on subRedit and came up with this
idea to try to crack it but it failed to solve it.

Then I thought I would use my idea to make my own cipher.
So that is how I came to make this one.

Maybe it's possible to solve as a large anagram, but I think that is a big ask.

ALL THE HINTS BROUGHT TOGETHER AND GIVEN IN SOLVED PLAINTEXT
=============================================================
1] cipher letters are usually given in this type of format. (UPPER CASE)
2] Your hint is the shift of this cipher also read the very puzzle/cipher itself for another! (24, HINTING AT THE NUMBER OF LETTERS, THEY NEED TWISTING IN LINES)
3] one particular math op will help you. (DIVISORS, THE TWISTING PARTITIONS)
4] use divisors wisely then divide and conquer each with a twist. (PAIR THEM)
5] choose the right twentyfour letters, use low high divisor pairs, reverse, split, until plaintext appears (ALMOST THE SOLUTION)

THE CIPHER:
===========
Yet To Solve ThiS One
tHe hIntS
eVery LIne Will EacH
ONLy BE a LittLE Twisted

THE PLAINTEXT:
===============
ONLY THE BEST WILL SOLVE THIS

THE SOLUTION:
=============
Use only the capital letters (the lowcase letters are dressing used as a hint)
Count of the capital letters = 24

Divisors of 24 = 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24.

Pair the low-high and high-low divisors:

1:24, 2:12, 3:8, 4:6, 6:4, 8:3, 12:2, 24:1

(for this cipher the 12:2 pair were not used but could have been)

Here are the steps to a solve:
01 Remove all lowercase letters
02 Make one group of the 24 capitals keeping them in the order given (1:24 pair)
03 Reverse the group (the twist)
04 Split to make 2 groups of 12 letters (2:12 pair)
05 Reverse each group
06 Split to make 3 groups of 8 letters (3:8 pair)
07 Reverse each group
08 Split to make 4 groups of 6 letters (4:6 pair)
09 Reverse each group
10 Split to make 6 groups of 4 letters (6:4 pair)
11 Reverse each group
12 Split to make 8 groups of 3 letters (8:3 pair)
13 Reverse each group
14 Make one group of the letters and edit to plaintext (24:1 pair)

CIPHER ONE
==========
you have clues and anagrams to help you get started with each cipher.
for instance the following should help you open up the next cipher, number two...
loves to rearrange the message in a way that makes it unreadable, but the clue here will help!

CIPHER TWO
==========
welcome to the world of ciphers - you have just decrypted the second cipher. 'loves to rearrange' was obviously the clue, an anagram of 'loves' giving the word 'solve' which is what you did! will there be a clue to the following cipher within the one just solved? re: leaving together this clue will help you see the next cipher that follows.

CIPHER THREE
============
its looking good now that the second cipher is cracked, 're: leaving together' was the clue so 're' and 'leaving' together anagram to revealing, you are surely on your way to fame so keep at it. the next challenge is just that, something you will have to queue for, but with cunning, insight and perseverance you will get your reward.
(Note I should have said 'third' not 'second')
CIPHER FOUR
===========
you never know when or if harry will at some future time use a quagmire four cipher, so having solved this puts you in good stead and readyness should the occasion arise.
i know that this text is not really long enough to do an analysis on to tell what type of cipher it might be that is why i gave you all the clues to it in cipher three - queue for (q4) and the three keywords were given. i did not intend you to have to find those but rather to have the ability to simply solve it, which you must have done to read this, so well done you!
if you want to post to prove that you have solved all the ciphers print the last word from each of the three preceding ciphers followed by a number being the count of the characters in your user name, for example 'tlw mini word word word ninteen' would be submitted by the-letter-wriggler.

TLW's A, B, C quizz. Can you answer these?
=========================================================== A ANSWER
GETTING ROPED IN
=================
The Length Of The Rope Was 5 Feet.

When the mother is three times as old as the monkey, let
their respective ages be 3x and x.
Thus the difference of their ages is 3x-1x = 2x(constant).
When the monkey is tree times as old as the mother then was, he will be 9x.
When the mother is half this age, she is 4.5x, and the monkey therefore is 2.5x.
Twice this i.e. 5x, is the mother's age at the time of the problem, and the
monkey's age is therefore 3x.
Now 5x + 3x is to equal 4, therefore x = 0.5, and 5x = 2.5,
therefore weight of monkey = weight of weight = 2.5 pounds = 40 oz.
And we are told (expressing all weights in ounces)
40 + weight of rope = 1.5(40 + 40 - 40) = 60,
therefore weight of rope = 60 - 40 = 20 oz,
Rope is 4oz per foot so 20/4 = 5
and therefore length of rope = 5 feet.

============================================ ANSWER
TLW A Six Fingered Alien.
==========================
Here is my answer. This is how I worked it out, there are other ways.

First calculte how many unique numbers are possible

12! 12!
-------- = ------- = 74484400 unique numbers
2!2!2!2!2!2! 2^6

(so we have 12 digit columns having 74484400 rows of numbers)

Now there can only be six different digits (1 2 3 4 5 and 6) in each
of the 12 columns that recur so:

74484400/6 = 1247400 recurences of the 6 digits.

With 1+2+3+4+5+6 = 21 the units column will total to 124700*21 = 26195400

This means each of the 12 columns will total 26195400*10^columns_power.

We can do this using Repunit(12) = 111111111111

26195400*111111111111 = 2910599999997089400

So my full workings are: ((12!/2^6)/6)*21*111111111111 = 29105999999999997089400

In number form:
479001600/64/6 = 1247400, 1247400*21 = 26195400, 26195400*111111111111 = 2910599999997089400

@TLW

Good news and bad news. The good news is that I can replicate your result for the
six-fingered alien. I did it by looping over all of the integers from 0 to 12!-1,
and converting each to a factoradic number (google me!), which is easily converted
to a permutation of 0,...,11. I rejected any permutation in which x+6 came before x,
for any x in 0,..,5, in order to eliminate duplicates. Then each permutation was
converted to a permutation of 1,...,6 with two copies of each digit. The permutations
were converted to integers and added to a running sum.

The bad news is that it is wrong. Here's why:

How many fingers does a six-fingered alien have? You might say six: three on each
hand (I'm assuming it has two hands). But then it would likely use a base-6 number
system. But "6" is not a digit in base 6, any more than "ten" is a digit in base 10.
So probably the alien has six fingers on each hand. This makes sense, because we
say that the three-toed sloth has three toes because it has three toes on each
foot, rather than three toes distributed over all feet. OK, so the alien probably
uses a base-12 number system. Your calculation assumed that all the numbers were
in base 10. If instead, we evaluate each of its 12-digit numbers as base-12 numbers,
then the answer (in base 10) is

21232801607474457000

and in base 12 (new digits are "a" and "b", but we could use dozenal notation
instead and use "T" and "E" or similar) is

96a15bbbbbbb251a60

Now, here's something interesting: The sum of the digits 1,...,6 is 21. And
the sum of such digits in the twelve spots is

2100000000000 + 210000000000 + 21000000000 + 2100000000 + 210000000 + 21000000
+ 2100000 + 210000 + 21000 + 2100 + 210 + 21 = 2333333333331.

This wondrous number evenly divides the sum 21232801607474457000, and
21232801607474457000 / 2333333333331 = 1247400

This last number, 1247400, represents the many ways of assigning the remaining
11 digits to their positions once we have fixed one. It is 11! / 2^5, since
there are 11 things to place in 11 spots, but five pairs of identical items
that we do not want to double-count.

What if we do this again in base 12? Then the sum of the digits 1,...,6 is 19,
and the sum of putting them in each of the twelve spots is

1900000000000 + 190000000000 + 19000000000 + 1900000000 + 190000000 +
19000000 + 1900000 + 190000 + 19000 + 1900 + 190 + 19 = 1aaaaaaaaaaa9

Now 96a15bbbbbbb251a60 / 1aaaaaaaaaaa9 = 501a60, but this is again 1247400 in base 10.

2] 1 the digit 1 appears twice
3] 0 the digit 3 appears 0 times

7] 0 the digit 7 appears 0 times
8] 0 the digit 8 appears 0 times
9] 0 the digit 9 appears 0 times

====================================================================
============================================ ANSWER
TLW The 10 Digit 'Tally Number' Continued
============================================
Note: No 'tally number' exists for bases 1,2,3 and 6.

[0123] base 4 two solutions
[1210]
[2020]

[01234] base 5 one solution
[21200]

For all bases above 6 there is just one solution.

In general using concatination of the bracketed sets we can use the following

[n][21][0..0][1000] (Martin Gardner called this the self-descriptive number)

where n is 4 less than the base,
the number of zero digits to include [0..0], is 7 less than the base,
and the 21 and 1000 are fixed digits.

So if b is the base number (higher that 6) then we calcuate thus:
[b-4][21][number of zeros = b-7][1000]

Working this for base 10 gives:
[n=10-4=6][21][10-7= 3 zeros][1000] so we have 6 21 000 1000 = 6210001000

and for other bases

[012345] base 7 [7-4][21][7-7][1000]=[3][21][][1000]
[301000]

[01234567] base 8 [8-4][21][8-7][1000]=[4][21][1][1000]
[42101000]

[012345678] base 9 [9-4][21][9-7][1000]=[5][21][2][1000]
[521001000]

[0123456789a] base 11 [11-4][21][11-7][1000]=[7][21][4][1000]
[72100001000]

[0123456789ab] base 12 [12-4][21][12-7][1000]=[8][21][5][1000]
[821000001000]

[0123456789abc] base 13 [13-4][21][13-7][1000]=[9][21][6][1000]
[9210000001000]

Double digit numbers or greater can be put like so:

Base 36 [36-4][21][0's: 36-7][1000] (32)21(29)1000

[012345678901234567890123456789012345]decimal count
[01233456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxy]
[v21000000000000000000000000000001000]

(note that v represents 32(in decimal) and that it appears once
and there are v zeros (32 zeros))
