Great puzzle! My guess is "The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe" by the great Northern Irish author C.S. Lewis?

-- One of Katy Perry's songs is called "Roar".
-- Hermione Grainger is a witch from the Harry Potter novels
-- Coco Chanel is a famous fashion designer

If I'm right, my puzzle is below:

Find the next three terms in the (infinite) sequence below and you will be in prime position to be the next KoC!

3, 5, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 10, ...

[@Harry don't post this bit -- the answer is:

9, 11, 8!

This is the sequence generated by the lengths of the positive prime numbers when written in English:

two, three, five, seven, eleven, thirteen, seventeen, twenty-three, twenty-nine, THIRTY-ONE, THIRTY-SEVEN, FORTY-ONE, ...]
