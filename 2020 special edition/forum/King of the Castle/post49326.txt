If the Ann and Bob had 2 had white hats, Carol would know that hers is black. She doesn't know so one (or both) of Ann and Bob will have a black hat. Had Bob seen a white hat on Ann, he would have said that his hat is black (because one of Alice and Bob must be black-hatted. So Ann knows that her hat is black because Bob doesn't know.
