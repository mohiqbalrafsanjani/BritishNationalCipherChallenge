Got it!

Book is: N or M? By Agatha Christie

[Very good! You are now KoC!]

My puzzle if this is right:

The following names will represent something and will be combined to make a book. For example for Taylor Swift we could put snake or for Belle we could put Beast.

A) Katy Perry
B) Hermione Granger
C) (This one is super hard it took me a while to think of it) Coco Chanel

This book is by someone who sounds like DJ Khalid and Lewis Capaldi combined. Good luck!
