TLW TAKING SIDES
================
There are 4 cards laid out on the table.
I tell you that each one is either red or green on one side, and that
each one has either a circle or a square on the other side.

Here is how they appear laid out:

#1[ RED ]#2[GREEN]#3[CIRCLE]#4[SQUARE]

Which are the ONLY numbered cards you need to pick up and turn over in order to have
SUFFICIENT information to answer the question:

Does every red card have a square on its other side?

Do you need to pick up just one, or just two, or just three or all four?
Give the number(s) of the cards and state why you chose them.
