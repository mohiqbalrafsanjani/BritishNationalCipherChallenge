It should be easy to back trace to... [2e] Top Centre Button

The number was the number of buttons to pass over and
the small letter was the direction to move n, s, e, w.

The sequence 01 to 25

[14][06][01][15][02]
[22][23][18][24][19]
[12][05][11][04][03]
[21][07][17][16][20]
[13][08][10][25][09]
