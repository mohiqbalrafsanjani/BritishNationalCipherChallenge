============================== ANSWER
TLW TAKING SIDES
================
#1[ RED ]#2[GREEN]#3[CIRCLE]#4[SQUARE]

Cards #1 and #3 are sufficient to deduce that every red card has a square on the other side.

Most people include #4 in their answer.
But consider: #2 does not matter, since the question is concerned with red cards.
If #1 has a circle, the answer to the question is no.
Similarly, if #3 is red the answer is no.
If #1 is a square, #3 is green, and #4 is either red or green the answer is yes.
Therefore the answer is #1 and #3.
