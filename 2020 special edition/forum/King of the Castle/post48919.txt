OK Madness I'll go again.
Shifty Times.
Here are 8 cards with letters that have been shuffled 4 times in a certain sequence.

[O] [N] [G] [I] [M] [U] [V] [P]

What did the cards show before 4 such shuffles?

How the cards were shuffled:
The digits 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 would become 3 6 5 8 7 1 2 4 after one shuffle like so...

1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 becomes
2 1 4 3 6 5 8 7 then the 1st 3 are put on the end
3 6 5 8 7 2 1 4 and then the 3 end cards are rearranged
3 6 5 8 7 1 2 4 this is 1 shuffle

This may be tricky as you have to do it in reverse!
