@TLW, I was busy with other things.

If you insist, here is one that I have not done yet. It was stolen from a website for a company that makes books and typefaces and stuff. They used to post weekly logic puzzles. I did one in about half an hour. I will also try to solve this one while you all work on it.

School of Government

Under cover of darkness, six men are meeting in a cabin in the North Woods. Mr. Grouper, Dr. Trout, Mr. Ray, Mr. Mackerel, 'The Snapper', and Mr. Bass must decide between them who will govern their super-secret ichthyological society. They are the only members eligible for the offices of President, Vice-President, and Secretary. And this is their challenge.

Grouper won't be an officer unless Snapper is President
Trout won't serve if he outranks Ray
Trout won't serve with Bass under any conditions
Ray won't serve with both Snapper & Bass
Ray won't serve if Bass is President or Trout is secretary
Mackerel won't serve with Ray or Snapper unless he outranks him
Snapper won't be Vice-President
Snapper won't be secretary if Mackerel is an officer
Snapper won't serve with Grouper unless Bass serves too
Bass won't serve unless either he or Ray is President

How can the three offices be filled?
