86! (It has two 'i's, three circles (which are the wheels), and one antenna, which is the top of the 6.)

Now for my puzzle. I call this puzzle 'An Initial Message'. Enjoy!
"The Hairy Elephant
Cannot Interfere Positively. He Enjoys Reading,
Heating Arsenic, Singing.
Beating Everyone Easily, Naturally,
Ensures No Crisis. Russia Yearned Precariously To Every Dane,
With Initially Two Hatters.
And
Very Interesting Games Ensures No Exciting Results. Egyptians
Cannot Interfere Positively. Hatred Ears Read
Ancient, Norwegian, Dusty
Typos. Hungarian Eggs
Keep Eating Yoghurt. Welsh Ostriches Release Dust
Violently. Instant Granules Excite No Exciting Russian Ethiopians."

To become KoC, simply post the final word in the message.
