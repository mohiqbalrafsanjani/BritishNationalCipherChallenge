Woohoo!

My next puzzle is more of a riddle, with some artistic (and poetic) licence!

"I'm double a prime, but I'm less than a ton,
Try and figure me out, come on let's have some fun.

My eyes, I have two, but my wheels I have three,
And one curved antenna, now what do you see?

Don't go to very much trouble or hassle,
Just post what I am, to be King of the Castle!"
