If the aim is to stay king of the castle for as long as possible then
I will not hold it for long with this -- it should be simple enough.

I am a word of ten letters.
My 1, 2, 8 is rainy
My 1, 5, 6, 7 is part of a birds body
My 8, 9, 10 is a weight
My 1, 2, 3, 4 is a spring
My 7, 5, 4, 8 is a golden surface
My 10, 9, 8, 2 is a short letter
My whole is a celebrated warrior

Who or What am I? (Incude the six clue answers if you wish)

I am retiring for the day so if someone solves it I will confirm in the morrow.
