Here is my next challenge. Enjoy!

Here is a grape (marked G) and a cherry (marked C) inside the lower part of a chair made up of four sticks (view in a monospaced font):
|_
|G|C

Move two sticks so that the grape is outside the chair and the cherry is inside, like this (this is obviously not a solution!):
|_
G|C |
You may change the orientation of the chair:
_
_|_
But you may not flip the chair:
|_|
|
And you cannot move the grape or the cherry:
|_
|C|G

Just submit answers by typing in the final positions. (Example below.) If you need to have a letter underlined (i.e. a stick directly underneath a letter), use the ‘UL’ symbol in the menu above your answer. (Note: Please correct me if I’m wrong, @Harry!) Enjoy!

(Example! You could type in, for instance:
_

    G

|

    C

)

[ANSWER PLEASE DO NOT POST THIS BIT
The answer is:
_ _
G|

    C

]
