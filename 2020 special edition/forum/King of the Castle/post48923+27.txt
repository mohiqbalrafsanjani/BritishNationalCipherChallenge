? = 13 because the sum of each row is an (ascending) multiple of 3

? = 3 or 6 because the product of each column is a divisor of 60

? = 0 so that the determinant of the matrix is zero

? = W because I said so

Sorry this took so long, I was eating lunch and taking a shower (not at the same time).

Yay, all valid -- was that better for you? I know it took you 1hr 15min to post after the question went up, I was watching! Are you going to be KoC now?

Here are the 3 I had...

0: If the first four cells in a column sum to an even number
the fifth cell in the column is 0, otherwise it is 1.
13: summing the numbers horizontally gives, respectively, 3, 6, 9, and 12,
continuing this suggests 13 (for a sum of 15).
4: based on observation that columns sum to even numbers while the rows sum to
multiples of 3 (and all the entries are single digits).
