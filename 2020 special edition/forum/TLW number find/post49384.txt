===================================== ANSWER
TLW A Number To Find
=====================
ANSWER 12

09==06
==06==
11==12

If we letter the square thus:
A=B
=E=
D=C

Then the 4 corner numbers relationship to the center square number is:
((D*B)-C)/A = E
so
((11*6)-C)/9 = 6
rearrange
(D*B)-(A*E) = C
(11*6)-(9*6) = 12

So @Puttputt86 is correct - well done for that one.
