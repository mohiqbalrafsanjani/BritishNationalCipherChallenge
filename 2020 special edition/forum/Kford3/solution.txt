The KA Answers - KA-3 (Initial Thoughts)

As @The-letter-wriggler correctly found out, the next term in the sequence could have been anything from Sitting In X to Stationary Indian X-Rays. But there is a pattern. Let's remind ourselves of the first five terms that I created:
Observing New Elephants
The Witty Ones
Tribe Hannibal Reaches Extraordinary Eras
Fire Obviously Utilises Rain
Fined In Venus's Earholes

The title was 'Initial Thoughts', and this could lead you to getting the initals of each word. What you get is ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR, FIVE. So the next term in the sequence must have had the initals of SIX, then SEVEN for the next one, and so on. Here is the remaining terms I thought of whilst posting this, to get from ONE to TWENTY:
(The first five are earlier in this post.)
Successful Iraqi Xylophones
