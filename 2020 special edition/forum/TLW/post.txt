All posts to go below and kept in this thread please.

When you have solved it choose any 6 non consecutive letters from the plaintext, retain their order from left to right, and post them without spaces as your answer.
Do not use the same 6 letters as other posts.

Your post to look like this: TLW Answer: ABCDEF

The first competitor to post the CORRECT answer gets all the glory.
Of course all other correct posts will be deemed very worthy too.
