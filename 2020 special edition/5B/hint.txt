Sure! The frequency analysis app on https://www.cipherchallenge.org/frequency-counter/ gives a result (for Challenge B) that looks remarkably like the usual frequency of English characters, so maybe they havenâ€™t been substituted. As well as that, the text has some suspicious looking capital letters which normally represent the beginnings of sentences or of proper names, and that might suggest a way to reorder the letters into something more closely resembling English.

Good luck!
