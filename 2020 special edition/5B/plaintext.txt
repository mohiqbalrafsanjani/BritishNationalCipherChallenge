Analysis of signals traffic from the French Ministry of Armaments show that Jacques Allier, a member of the Deuxieme Bureau, was involved in something important. We arranged to have him followed, and he was observed to purchase travel documents for Norway. Previously Allier had worked at the Banque de Paris des Pays-Bas, and records show that this organisation held most of Norsk Hydro's shares at that point, leading to the supposition that he would be visiting the hydroelectric plant in Rjukan. Agents were charged with following him and reporting on his movements. While in Norway, he purchased space for a cargo of around one hundred kilograms on a flight from Stockholm to Amsterdam, together with a passenger ticket. Suspecting that he was transporting Heavy Water from the plant, the Luftwaffe was tasked with intercepting the flight and redirecting the plane to Hamburg. Our agents boarded it there and searched it, but there was no sign of the cargo, and Allier's name was missing from the manifest. Further enquiries in Stockholm showed that he had missed the flight, but we could find no trace of him in the city. Our agents at the airfield reported that an RAF plane had arrived and left around the same time as the passenger aircraft, but no records exist showing the purpose of that visit. It is possible that Allier used it to leave Norway, but we do not know what cargo, if any, he took with him. Our agents in Rjukan broke into the Norsk Hydro administration and found a record showing that the plant had held a stock of around one hundred and eighty kilograms of Deuterium, but they were unable to gain access to the storage units in order to determine how much was removed by Allier, if any.
