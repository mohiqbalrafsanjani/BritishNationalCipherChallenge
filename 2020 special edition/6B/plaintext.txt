Uranprojekt Special Orders for Sixty Ninth Infantry Division, Commanded by Generalmajor Hermann Tittel: Once the initial objectives of Unternehmen Weseruebung have been achieved an elite task force is to be assembled and ordered to proceed at all speed to Rjukan, where they are to take possession of the Norsk Hydro factory. Staff at the facility are to be treated well, but must not, under any circumstances, be allowed to leave the area. The power plant should be surveyed, secured and placed under twenty-four-hour guard. Stocks of heavy water should be held in the most protected location within the facility, preferably underground, and certainly under armed guard. Once the area is secure, the SS will take control of Norsk Hydro, its operations and its security. The Wehrmacht will continue to provide area patrols and to police local residents. Once the plant is secured and its staff have been placed under house arrest you will contact the Reichserziehungsministerium, who will furnish further orders. NH staff will be under the authority of the Ministry, exercised through the SS.
