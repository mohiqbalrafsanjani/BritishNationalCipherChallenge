I really enjoyed this one -- a great challenge! Starting to test the limits of my approach of only using MS Excel to help me solve the challenges!

The reference to Norsk Hydro in 6A didn't help me too much -- too many permutations of SK and KH to cycle through! My main breakthrough actually came when I factorised the total number of characters in the ciphertext into its prime divisors -- clearly this won't always work, but it did in this case!

I know it's not needed, but is the keyword "[... Harry]" by any chance?

[A nice set of hints here from icybee. Harry]

When decrypting transposition ciphers, it's a good idea to factor in the length of the message (sometimes).

Also watch out for German words in inconvenient places. Maybe look for recognisable phrases lower down!
