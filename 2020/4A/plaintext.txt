I have drawn a blank in my enquiries about Caistor St Edmund and even Harry is getting nowhere with his contacts in the MOD. We both agree that the silence is very worrying. This is clearly an area of interest as it presents a crucial front in any potential invasion so we would have expected some interest in our intelligence, or at least some push back warning us to keep away from basic defence installations like listening posts. The fact that no-one wants to talk about the facilities in the area suggests that it is all very hush hush. Something important is happening there and we probably want to find out what.

Our agents in London kept watch for the touring party and recorded them as arriving at Liverpool Street. The group consisted of twenty three cyclists who split up and stayed with members of local scout groups while their leader was hosted by a member of the local Ortsgruppe. We received reports from Kâ€™s network that the group has been invited to stay with the Spalding Rotary Club in Lincoln and we need you to investigate any reports you can find about that visit. I will continue to press for information about strategic developments in Norwich and Norfolk.

The Akela initiative has been given approval and I will be setting that up this week. The intention is to enroll leaders and members of local scout groups, train them in counter-intelligence and use them to host the spyclist touring groups in the hope of getting inside their operation. Since future communications may include sensitive operational details of this initiative I intend to increase security by moving to a blocked keyword cipher.

The attached document was intercepted by our London agents when the party posted it on arrival at Liverpool Street. As usual it was addressed to Tirpitzufer. Primary analysis suggests that it does not use a substitution cipher.

More to follow.

Pearl.
