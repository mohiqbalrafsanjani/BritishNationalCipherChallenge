Dear Uncle Wilhelm, The tower at Canewdon is as interesting as you had suggested it would be and I can see how it would lift the spirits of our English hosts, making them feel safe and secure in their fortress island STOP Nevertheless, nothing on the earth is forever and I think they may have a misplaced faith in this and the heavenly powers may not be strong enough to protect them from the oncoming storm STOP The local Ortsgruppe shared with me your latest gift, the beautiful clock device, and we have spent much time admiring it STOP Its simplicity is admirable and once we have learned to use it properly it will provide us all with a very high level of security STOP Safety must be our primary concern now as a lack of concentration at this point could bring disaster STOP Ralf has been given the accompanying key by the Ortsgruppe in Kent, and once we are reunited I will use this to secure our future communications STOP Establishing a safe plan for our journey home is essential in order to avoid unpleasant surprises STOP Quarrels with our host would be difficult to resolve and I would prefer it if we could slip away unremarked STOP Use of the local fishing boats might be possible, but if anything were to alarm the locals that might well prevent our departure and the clock could fall into the wrong hands STOP If you have a suggestion about how best to arrange our travel then please let us know and we will make the required arrangements STOP Ralf's party will return to London this week and will then travel to meet with us for the final stage of our adventure, when we will all regroup before returning home STOP Even if you do not wish us to proceed with our original plan then we are able to return with a whole treasure of drawings, photographs and descriptions of these important landmarks for you and your friends to study STOP Details of your wishes should be sent in the usual way using your remarkable clock device STOP Karl
