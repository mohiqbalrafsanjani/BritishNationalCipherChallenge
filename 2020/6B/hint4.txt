Maybe Harry will think that my clock runs in advance and what follows is TNT.
A help to simplify substitution. We can't use the frequency counter of the site because it needs only groups of 1 letter.
So I substitute 1 letter in place of 2 letters.
- Copy the large text divided in blocks of 2 into a text editor, in uppercases.
- Select the first group "AD" and replace all with "a" lowercase in red.
- Go to the next group of 2 "DF" and replace all with "b" and so on.
You will end with a simple substitution cipher easier to solve. There is a big crib.
If you compare the plain text with the text in groups of 2 you can fill in the ADFGVX grid. Look at the key: EUREKA!
:)
Et voila.
