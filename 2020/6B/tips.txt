Mission 6B requires you to crack a professional cipher that the German military  considered unbreakable for many years. It was  designed for use by frontline troops,  so is straightforward to implement, but very hard to crack. It is a 2-stage cipher involving  a substitution followed by a column transposition, and if you only knew that then it would be hard to crack even with a computer. Luckily the cryptanalysts at BOSS have examined this cipher for you and have worked out the  column transposition step, giving you the key in the mission briefing. If you haven’t already cracked 6A then I suggest you do that first. Since Pearl is very worried about security at this stage of the operation she has used a very tough cipher for that too, but she told you in last week’s mission briefing that she was going to do that, and what length the key will be,  so if you read that through you will see which type of cipher she has used to secure this weeks brief. Then you will have to do some research to find out how that sort of cipher works.  Agent Madness has written a supplement to our codebreaking guide to help you with this, and you can find it in the Case Files. We will ask the team if they have any more advice about cracking  the cipher in Mission 6B later in the week, so keep checking the case files section for more guidance. Harry
