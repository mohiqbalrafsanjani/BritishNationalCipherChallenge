If permitted...

I used the "letters" alphabet from the "UK" side of this table:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baudot_code#Baudot_code_(ITA1)

and also this table, which is the same:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baudot_code#Original_Baudot,_domestic_UK

Itâ€™s already got / and * (DEL) and -
The upwards pointing arrow is surely the "shift" to the figures alphabet
That just leaves _ and the white square to identify in the ciphertext; one being the blank space character and the other the null character
