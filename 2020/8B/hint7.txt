First, NOT IN ITA2. The alphabet is mentioned earlier in the thread. Nevertheless, it should be irrelevant
what the alphabet is. There are 32 ciphertext symbols, and you want to decrypt to 32 plaintext symbols so
that there are letters and spaces and a few punctuation marks, and no nulls (the boxes) and no shifts (the arrows).
After applying all previous hints, what should remain is a substitution. If this is too much of a hint, Harry
can butcher it like he butchered the losers of last year's competition. That last sentence will certainly be
censored, and should be blamed on too many horror films.

Regarding ham radio, I was thinking to simply connect MY computers that are located in distant lands and not all
able to use the usual internet. And if someone want to use my private network, they will have to register with
a call sign, a blood sample, and a million pounds sterling.
