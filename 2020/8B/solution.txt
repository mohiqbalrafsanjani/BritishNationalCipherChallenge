In the ciphertext, the blank box represents a null character, up arrow
represents shift, and underscore represents a space.

In the plaintext, "/" represents a comma, "*" a period (stop), and
double "**" ends a paragraph.

The plaintext was first encrypted with a monoalphabetic substitution.
The alphabet was mixed with the Wheatstone prescription and keyword FAILURE.
Then, it was converted into 5-bit Baudot code. Each block of five
characters was rotated by 90 degrees and then decoded back into
characters.
