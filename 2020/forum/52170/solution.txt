Replace each smiley-wink with a SPACE
Replace each smiley-smile with a SPACE
Replace all 'HoHoHo!' with a - (dash)
Replace all 'Ho!' with a . (dot)

The edited plaintext
====================
You know Dasher and Dancer
And Prancer and Vixen
Comet and Cupid
And Donner and Blitzen
But do you recall
The most famous reindeer of all?

Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer
Had a very shiny nose
And if you ever saw it
You would even say it glows
All of the other reindeer
Used to laugh and call him names
They never let poor Rudolph
Play in any reindeer games

Then one foggy Christmas Eve
Santa came to say
Rudolph with your nose so bright
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?
Then how the reindeer loved him
As they shouted out with glee
"Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer
You'll go down in history!"

Solved it? Then post 'You got me singing'
================================================
