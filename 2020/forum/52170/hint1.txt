Congratulations to those who got in the choir before the extension.

We just pulled a cracker and on the tinsel paper that fell out it reads...

"A hint? HoHoHo!" Says Santa dashing through the snow, "Ho! they need a hint"
say the dotty elves all spaced out winking and smiling. "That will do" says
Mrs Claus, "and now to your chores, I'm sure with that they will find a song and join in."

And that is no joke!
