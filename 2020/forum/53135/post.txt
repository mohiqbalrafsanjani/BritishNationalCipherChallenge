Very clever, @Madness. Great deduction skills.

I have another challenge, (hopefully) not to difficult. This took be ages to make. Over a day, for such a small ciphertext. I doubt youâ€™ll be able to make a reply quickly, so just send me the MD5 PLaintext+YOURNAME. Remember to retain the case for this!

90 85 74 33 47 75 85 91 49 49 6 75 85 53 8 7

Sorry that's all I can manage!
