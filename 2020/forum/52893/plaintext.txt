IF YOU WISH TO DECRYPT THIS SPECIFIC CLOCK CIPHER WITHOUT ANY CRIBS, THERE IS A WAY YOU CAN DO IT. (THIS ALSO EXPLAINS HOW SO MANY PEOPLE HAVE SOLVED MADNESS'S CIPHER ALREADY -- AT LEAST, THAT'S WHAT I'M ASSUMING.) TO DO THIS, YOU MUST DO BIGRAM ANALYSIS (WITH THE CIPHERTEXT ALPHABET -- IN THIS CASE, 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ[PLUS][HASHTAG]'. THIS WORKS IN EXACTLY THE SAME WAY AS FREQUENCY ANALYSIS, BUT WITH PAIRS OF LETTERS RATHER THAN INDIVIDUAL LETTERS. IF YOU DO THIS, YOU WILL SEE THAT A BUNCH OF BIGRAMS DO NOT APPEAR IN THE CIPHERTEXT. SOME OF THESE WILL BE DOUBLE LETTERS (FOR EXAMPLE, 'AA') -- THIS I LEAVE YOU TO PROVE -- BUT YOU SHOULD FOCUS ON THE ONES THAT ARE NOT. 28 OF THESE BIGRAMS WILL FORM PART OF THE KEY USED ON THE CIPHER CLOCK, GOING ANTICLOCKWISE. SIMPLY GET THESE 28 BIGRAMS AND JOIN THEM UP TO CREATE THE KEY. NOW YOU CAN DECRYPT YOUR CHOSEN MESSAGE WITH EASE. (P.S. THERE IS ONE MORE NOTE. IF YOU DO DECRYPT YOUR MESSAGE AND YOU GET SOME NONSENSICAL TEXT, DO NOT PANIC! THIS CAN BE SOLVED USING THE CAESAR SHIFT CIPHER -- OR IF, LIKE THIS MESSAGE, THE INSIDE LETTERS DO NOT FOLLOW THE ENGLISH ALPHABET, USE A MONOALPHABETIC SUBSTITUTION CIPHER (BEST TACKLED USING STANDARD FREQUENCY ANALYSIS.))
