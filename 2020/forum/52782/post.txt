Hello,

Here is another challenge, taken from the "Cold War Spy Pocket Manual". In the appendix, the book contains a challenge a number of such challenges most of which I was able to solve somehow. This one, however, resisted up to now.

There is no further information about the cipher, but maybe someone around here has an idea what kind of encryption it might be.
