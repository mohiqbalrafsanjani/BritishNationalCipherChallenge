Remember this spring when there were some challenges that were a Caesar or affine cipher combined with
a permutation (block transposition) cipher? Well, I was doing nothing yesterday, and I realized that
if the block size of the permutation is the same as the key length for a Vigenere, then it should be
easy to break a ciphertext that was encrypted with a Vigenere and a permutation. So here one is. Have fun.
