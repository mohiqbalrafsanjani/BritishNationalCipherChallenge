A new one for you all. No plaintext, only a clue towards the key. It is a famous book, written in the 1800s (can't specify the year -- it's the top of the list!) turned into multiple films, and even a LEGO set. The key takes text straight from the beginning so you won't have to search far. One final thing -- my wording was very careful in that last sentence ;)
