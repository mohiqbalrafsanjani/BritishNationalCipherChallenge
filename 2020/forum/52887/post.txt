The one-time pad is a cipher which is completely uncrackable due to its use of a key as long as the message that is being transmitted however it has the issue of needing both people to already have the key without it having fallen in enemy hands to work. The challenge is to crack this message which is known to have been encrypted with a OTP:

WBEPQQCSXUKRZHQUFLBSBTKSMERTLKKKAHMHGBGVYSTWCSRCLXKHXYXFCHDXNOCFKBAGRRZWKXDU
However, luckily because this would be impossible without it, we have also intercepted the message sent before it by the same person and got hold of the plaintext used to create that message:
