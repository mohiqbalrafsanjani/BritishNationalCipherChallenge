Back in October, I came up with a puzzle that, retrospectively, I shouldn't have expected to get a response to since all puzzles since have clearly been set by people far more intelligence than me and as such their puzzles are rather more interesting. However, The-letter-wriggler made an attempt and told me that, fairly enough, I probably didn't explain it properly. The puzzle was as follows:

i am InTerested In LearnIng To fInd, LogIcaLly, if ThIs conceaLed texT Is Truly invIsibLe If I hIde It so.
iT TruLy Took aT leasT tweLve mInuTes In Lining up The IndivIdual words.
i wIsh, Therefore, to see If a LoT of atTempTs couLd be Issued To solve It.
ThIs lasT senTence shouLd InsTantLy indIcaTe i am wrIting the Longest word, i ThInk its Length Is ITs cLear indIcation thIs word Is Longer.

As he/ she then said to post the answer if nobody solves it, and in the excessively optimistic and unrealistic scenario that anyone wanted to know the answer, I am writing a solution below. For those who might not have seen the original and would like to try, I am encoding the solution with a normal Rot13 cipher. (Context: the text above has a concealed message that then gives a five letter word, which is the answer.)
