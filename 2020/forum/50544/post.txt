A little puzzle that I came up with and wanted to see if it works...
... this puzzle is in the form of concealed text and isn't intended to be very difficult. You should end up with a five letter word (Clue: association with a fictional detective). You'll know once you've got the answer, unless I haven't double checked it well enough.
