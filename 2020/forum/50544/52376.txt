This new text will work. I have altered the endings of two of the lines
and made sure all the needed capitals are there. It does not matter that
some of the i's, t's and l's are not used.

Deleting everything except the capital letters gives (the secret Morse):

IITILITILILTILTITILIIIIL
ITTLTTTLITILTIIL
IITILTTTLITIL
ITTLITLITIILITILIITLIIIL
