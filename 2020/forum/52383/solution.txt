      Come from my first, ay, come;
      The battle dawn is nigh,
  And the screaming trump and the thundering drum
      Are calling thee to die.
      Fight, as thy father fought,
      Fall, as thy father fell:
  Thy task is taught, thy shroud is wrought,
      So forward and farewell!

      Toll ye my second, toll;
      Fling high the flambeau’s light,
  And sing the hymn for a parted soul
      Beneath the silent night.
      The helm upon his head,
      The cross upon his breast,
  Let the prayer be said, and the tear be shed
      Now take him to his rest!

      Call ye my whole, go call
      The lord of lute and lay,
  And let him greet the sable pall
      With a noble song to-day.
      Ay, call him by his name,
      No fitter hand may crave
  To light the flame of a soldier’s fame
      On the turf of a soldier’s grave!

(from Twentieth Century Standard Puzzle Book by Cyril Pearson)
