I'm bored. Here is an interesting cipher:

The Chase cipher is an invention of Pliny Chase from the 1800s. It begins with a 3×10 grid in which
we place the alphabet, mixed perhaps with a keyword. The remaining four spaces are filled with other
symbols; we will use the digits 2, 3, 4, 5 (0 and 1 look too much like O and I).

  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
0 K E Y W O R D 2 A 3
1 B C F G H I J L M 4
2 N P Q S T U V X Z 5

Notice that the table has headings for the 10 digits along the top, and 0, 1, 2 on the side. These are the
coordinates of each character in the grid.

We take our secret message:

THIS MESSAGE WAS ENCRYPTED WITH A CHASE CIPHER

We need to decide on a period. We can take the entire message at one go, or break it into words, or
break it into blocks of the same length. For security, we should either use the entire message at once or
use blocks whose lengths are all the same. For this example, we take blocks of length five, and pad the
last block.

THISM ESSAG EWASE NCRYP TEDWI THACH ASECI PHERX

For each block, we fractionate by writing the coordinates of the letters in two rows, like this:

THISM
21121
44538

We take the bottom row and treat it like an integer; in our case, the integer is 44538. Then we perform
some mathematical operation on that integer. Here there is some flexibility, but both parties to the
message must agree on what operation to use. The only requirement is that it must be reversible, so that
the recipient can decipher the message. For example, we might multiply by 7. Our new set of
coordinates is

021121
311766

Notice that we add a zero to the beginning of the upper row, so that both rows have the same length.
We could add any of 0, 1, or 2, and should choose randomly, for security. The new coordinates are
converted back into characters, according to the table.

021121
311766
WPCLVJ

One possibility for the full ciphertext is

WPCLVJ K3SVAC B3DAP2 BPBDOX Q5EOOI SPGD4M UAPABI B54K35

The Chase cipher is very flexible in how it is set up. The length of the blocks can be changed, as
can the mathematical operation used in the enciphering. With another choice of operation, such as
taking the first few digits of the logarithm after the decimal point, the blocks in the ciphertext can be
the same length as the blocks in the plaintext, rather than requiring the addition of an extra digit, as in
our example.

Challenge

This ciphertext was encrypted using multiplication by 7. The leading digit for the top row was always
chosen randomly. Plaintext blocks are 5 letters; ciphertext blocks are 6. I have no idea if it is
possible to break it. If you do it, please report how. All glory to the one who succeeds.
