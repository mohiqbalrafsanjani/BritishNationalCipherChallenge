Here is a message to you using Trigrams instead of Bigrams, the same coding applies:

Also you would benefit to learn to use the MD5 hash so we can answer without giving it away.
All plaintext is put in uppercase with no spaces and then the user-name put on the end, in uppercase also, then an md5 is generated from that.
In my case the MD5 of PLAINTEXT+TLW is: 7477126d4c9979c7ac55a8da19b27c77

This is a very simple cipher (no shame in that) and ideal for those relatively new to have a go at solving it.
Nice to see you participate, not many do. No one needs to be an expert, people of all levels should post their ciphers
but please be aware that you need to give Harry the plaintext and how it is enciphered before he will post.
