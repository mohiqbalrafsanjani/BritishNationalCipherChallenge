@Cribbage, that is not how I would do it. All that thinking would hurt my brain (assuming I am not a noncorporeal heuristic
algorithm floating in cyberspace). But if you want to do all that cognitizing, carry on. I think where you have "gone wrong"
is to assume that ALL possibilities are present in the ciphertext.

Do you want a hint?
