This lesson is intended to teach the code or key. Attention is called to the mathematical regularity of its construction, which will enable the teacher to demonstrate it in a very simple manner. First write the column of numbers from one to twenty-four. Then opposite number one place five red circles in a row. Under the last one in this row, and on a line with number two place a blue circle, and continue alternating red and blue down the column. Then under the fourth red circle in the first row place another red one, then two blue ones, alternating two reds with two blues down the column. In the third column the reds and blues alternate in sets of four; in the second column, in sets of eight, and in the first column, in sets of sixteen. Since only twenty-four combinations are necessary, the last eight of the possible thirty-two have been omitted. Now opposite these twenty-four combinations place the letters of the alphabet in regular order, remembering that I and J, U and V are used interchangeably.
In this clock the movable colored dots indicating the minutes are used to spell out the time in cipher. In the working cards to be provided for the child the colored dots are to be inserted in the holes made for the purpose around the face of the clock. There being sixty dots, any phrase expressive of time not exceeding twelve letters in length (that is, twelve times five dots for each letter equals sixty) is available for indicating the time in cipher. That is to say, any phrase such as half-past ten, nine-thirty, etc., can be indicated on the clock by using five times as many dots as there are letters in the phrase selected. Should there be less than twelve letters in the phrase, the holes remaining are to be left blank. This lesson is extremely flexible in respect to the many combinations which it makes possible. The teacher or parent should bear in mind that the most effective use of the clock is to be attained by first choosing a phrase designating some time of the day which is significant in the daily experience of the child--such as the opening or closing hour of school, the play hour, the dinner hour, or bed-time. This phrase is converted into cipher by having the child place the dots representing the letters of the phrase, beginning at the figure twelve, around the clock face. After this has been done the child should be asked to decipher the phrase by naming the letter which each group of five dots stands for. When this is accomplished, the ability to read the time becomes an unconscious achievement, since the hands of the clock are then placed by the parent or teacher, or by the child under her direction, in the proper position to indicate the deciphered phrase. If, for example, the phrase half-past nine is selected and the child has extracted this from the colored dot combination, the hands of the clock are moved to nine-thirty. The child, with the phrase fresh in his mind, learns from this the position of the hands of the clock representing the time, since the mental image of the clock face with the hands in the required position establishes an association which becomes indelibly impressed on the child's mind. The method here described is the best for young children. With children of more advanced age and greater ability to use their own minds, the reverse practice may be followed. The teacher may name the phrase designating the time, and direct the child to put in place the colored dots representing the letters of the phrase by referring for each letter to the code. This requires an intelligence of a higher order than the method first described.
