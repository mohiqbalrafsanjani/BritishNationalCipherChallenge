@Person314, well done as well! Note that you were interested about solving the cipher without use of the clues, so I have encrypted the below message using the same cipher, alphabet and key as the final answer of my puzzle (i.e. the answer you posted to the forum).

@Person314, thank you for your solution. I have checked and confirmed your answer as correct. I will be posting a cipher in the 'Not Enough Suffering' topic soon (once I can get the correct functions out of my 2000 edition of Excel), so look out for that!
