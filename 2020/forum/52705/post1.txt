[Looks interesting. Could you send me the plaintext, the formatted ciphertext and the encryption method and any code used by email so I can take a look before posting? Harry]

For those of you who have already solved 7B, and are looking for another challenge, take a shot at this cipher. My creation. Consider it an unofficial bonus challenge.

Warning: This cipher is DEVILISHLY difficult! The hint is in the title :)

Note: This cipher is not related to Challenge 7B or any of the other challenges in this competition.
