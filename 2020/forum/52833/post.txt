Hi all,

A ciphering method I have come across, which I think I could share. Below is an encrypted plaintext, but the message has been encrypted by a series of moves rather than a key or a table. Hint: It is alike to an anagram (in the sense that it has the same letters in ciphertext to plaintext) but involving splitting into 2 letter groups. The plaintext below is the method used to get there.

If decrypted correctly it should come out as a message with no punctuation.

Best of luck, I'll be interested as to who solves it. If hints ar needed, I'll happily give a few.
