Because we know you miss us already, and because there is a little more of the tale to tell, here is a final mission for you.
As you might guess, the document in part B is an intercept and since it is encrypted with a very difficult cipher, its contents must be important.
Unless you can crack it, the final piece of the puzzle will remain unplaced.
Don't worry if you can't solve it, we will publish the solution on Thursday eighteenth of March.
Of course, if you can crack it, then well done!
The first ten to do so will be added to the list of ELITE cipher crackers, joining the happy band who solved the bonus cipher in Spring.
