My dear Jessica, I am writing to wish you well in your new life. I am sure you will not forget us, and you can be sure that we will not forget you. May your business flourish to the great benefit of us all. You might be concerned that with the growing uncertainty in the homeland we will find it difficult to continue to communicate, but love will find a way, and I am sure you love your homeland as much as we do. We trust that our effort to stay in touch will be rewarded by an equal effort on your part. I hope that my nephew Karl, who brings you this message, will be able to help you further with these matters. In the meantime, perhaps you can help him. He is a great lover of trains, canal boats and aeroplanes, and it would be a great kindness if you would agree to help him to explore some of the many transport treasures hidden across the UK. It is an unusual passion but I hope that you will feel able to assist him in this. He is particularly keen to explore the possibility of photographing as many of the intriguing travel sites as he can. I seem to recall that Uncle Wilhelm introduced you to the fascinating hobby of photographic reproduction when you stayed with his family in Tirpitzufer. If you were able to assist Karl by developing his films and forwarding them to his home that would, I am sure, avoid unnecessary delay and a great deal of unpleasant misunderstanding. If there is any way we can assist you in your valuable work please let Karl know and we will endeavour to oblige you. Your dear friend, Nikolaus R.
