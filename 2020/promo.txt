In the lead up to WWII the British intelligence services were flooded with reports of Nazi spies and sympathisers. With war fast approaching and limited resources the task of vetting all these reports was passed to a fledgling security organisation known as BOSS. As a new recruit you are given the job of decoding the secret messages that will expose the enemy agents.
It is a race against time and your country needs you...
