Dear Uncle Wilhelm, As you promised, we thoroughly enjoyed our visit to your cousin in Lincoln and found it most informative STOP The beautiful cathedral almost justified our visit on its own, and our hosts shared with us some interesting drawings of the towers you mentioned STOP They graciously allowed me to copy the sketches and explained much about how the towers are built and why STOP As usual I will send you my notes and sketches via our dear friend Jessica, who has promised to ensure their safe delivery STOP Really I must congratulate our hosts in the local scout groups for the marvellous way in which they have organised our travel, though some of the scouts have been rather more solicitous than we had expected, asking rather a lot of questions about our plans STOP Generally I hope they were satisfied with the answers that we gave, but we feel that we are at risk of overstaying our welcome, so we will return to London on Tuesday STOP Even though we have enjoyed our time together, there has been some debate among the group about where we should visit next STOP There are so many interesting sites to visit along the majestic Thames estuary, so we have decided to split into two groups STOP Ralf will lead one party on a tour of the Kent coast, while I am very much looking forward to exploring the Essex marshes STOP Do let me know if you have a better idea, but I have been told that Canewdonâ€™s fifteenth century church affords an elevation with a wide view of the surrounding lands in this otherwise rather flat landscape, and is the site of another fascinating tower, which I will be certain to sketch for you STOP Finally, if you have any further requests for specific information then perhaps you could leave a message for me at the post office there STOP Karl MESSAGE ENDS
