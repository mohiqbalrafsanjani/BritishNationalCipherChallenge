Dear Uncle Wilhelm, Our journey to London was short and charming, the trains rattling along the British tracks through open fields and countryside. Their roads may be almost impassable in places, but these iron tracks provide a very usable way to travel across country at speed. Our hosts in London have organised for us to stay with members of the British Scouting Movement, though I will spend the next few days with the Ortsgruppe, exchanging news about the Fatherland and their activities here in the capital city. It was difficult to tear ourselves away from the pleasures of Norfolk and the City offers far fewer opportunities for open exploration. On the other hand the bustle of the city, as in Berlin, offers a certain anonymity and it is in some ways relaxing to leave behind the gossip and inquisitiveness of village life. As you suggested we will use our time here in London to support our brothers and sisters and to reassure them that they have not been forgotten. I will pass on the gifts that you entrusted to me, together with your instructions for their use, as we did in Caistor St Edmund. The radio you sent me is remarkable. It is able to pick up signals across the spectrum, even from Berlin itself, though I am enjoying listening to British radio, especially the home service. They are building a chain of transmitters across the country which provide information throughout the day and night, something that I think you might want to take into account when planning our own radio services. I am assuming that there are no changes planned for our itinerary, but if there are then perhaps you could forward them to our hosts in Spalding, with a copy sent post-restante to CsE. Yours sincerely
