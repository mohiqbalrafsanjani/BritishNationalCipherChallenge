Challenge Six - first hint

Many (not all) of the heiroglyphs can be found on the website. You might be able to work out what they stand for from that, though transliterating heiroglyphs is not an exact science and in particular vowels can be muddled. You could also try frequency analysis on the heiroglyphs to sort out which ones stand for E and T. To get you started here is a table of the vowels as they are used in the Journal:
