can it be true that my precious babylon stone will be shipped to
southampton? i shall return with all speed to england and organise
its interception. M will travel with me, as my brother feels i may
still be at risk, though since my enemies believe they have already
defeated me with their foolish encryptions, i am certain now that
they will interpret my departure as an admission of defeat.

my plans beyond southampton are unclear, but what is certain is that
the stone must be kept safe from those who would deprive us of it.
i have made contact with a collector in new york who has expressed
interest in obtaining the stone. he has promised to exhibit it and
his commission may well lead to further field work.

legend or none, i believe i have broken the curse associated with
the stone at last.
