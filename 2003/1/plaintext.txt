today i shall set sail for alexandria on the suevic. the tale of this
remarkable ship is one of triumph against adversity, and i can't help
hoping that her successful salvage is an omen for my voyage.

a few weeks ago i received a letter from my brother jack, who is serving
as a police inspector in cairo. knowing my archaeological ambitions, he
wrote to tell me about a clay tablet recently found in an egyptian pyramid.
what is strange is that the markings on it seem to be babylonian, and not
egyptian. nobody knows how it got there or why. it is rumoured to contain
ancient knowledge known to the babylonians and rediscovered by the greeks.
this is just the sort of mystery i need. i am determined to see this tablet,
and to solve the puzzle of the message it contains. jack warned me that it
is said to be cursed, and on a more practical note, that a party of german
academics have expressed interest in it.
