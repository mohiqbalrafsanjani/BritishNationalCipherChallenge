alexandria august 1911

my journey here has not
been in vain, though the need for secrecy grows daily. my friend
massoud has taught me much about the desert, explaining the strange
circumstances of the deaths at the museum. if those murders were
carried out by my pursuers then i am in great danger.

it appears that the missing circles of cloth may have been used in a
strange ritual used to encourage the snakes to strike at those who had
worn the cloth. my guide would not tell me any more, and i am not sure
i wish to hear it, but it is clear that whoever used such a barbaric
method merely to frighten the other guards will have no qualms about
hurting me. on the other hand i may be of more use alive. they
could use me to get at jack and obtain access to the
stone.

the markings on the stone are certainly babylonian. it is said that they
describe equations suggesting that pythagoras was not the first to
discover his eponymous theorem, but that cannot explain the fear of the
stone which according to massoud has been cursed for as long as it has
existed.

the fear of the curse may explain why the stone was placed in the
pyramid. perhaps it was felt that the mass of the surrounding rock
would protect the community from its baleful influence.
