my time here in cairo has been a mixture of joy and irritation. it was
wonderful to see jack again, but his determination to protect me was
harder to deal with than the patronising attitude of my tutors at oxford.

having determined not to allow the prejudices of my tutors to inhibit
my ambition, i most certainly will not allow folk superstition to deter
me from discovering the secrets of this so-called cursed slab. it is
currently under guard in the museum here, though finding guards is not
an easy task, given the strength of the superstition. neither was jack
helped by the untimely deaths of the three guards who manhandled the
stone into its resting place in the display. snakebite is far from
uncommon in egypt, and the hysteria surrounding the three separate
incidents betrays a less than stable attitude. nonetheless, the mysterious
fact that in each case there was a six-inch circle of fabric cut from the
tail of the deceased's shirt has set me thinking that perhaps there is
more to these incidents than the authorities will admit. the slab must
be guarded at all costs while i continue my investigations.

i will travel to alexandria where i am told i may find the bedouin who
brought the legend of the babylon stone to our attention.
