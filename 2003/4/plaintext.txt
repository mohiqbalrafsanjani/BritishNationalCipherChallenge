so much to write about, but no time to write it.

on my return to cairo, jack presented me with the most awful news:
it appears that the museum guards were frightened off by stories of
the curse and a further death, with only jack to guard the stone.
theft was an easy matter, and jack was convinced that the party of
german academics had taken it to be shipped to munich.

fortunately, i had already sketched the stone. i have the inscription
safe and have spent some time deciphering the glyphs upon it. it
appears to be a record of calculations of pythagorean triples, though
to what purpose i do not know.

i recall now the death myth surrounding the pythagorean discovery of
irrational numbers, and wonder if there is a connection with the curse
associated with the babylon stone. i can only hope that i may defy the
curse that seems to be haunting my enquiries.

my own resources are dwindling, and i have recruited the assistance of
a cousin of massoud who has somehow obtained the shipping plan of my
german rivals. early inspection suggests that the shipping plan is
encrypted using an anagram cipher, and that part of the document is
written in english. if it is possible to decipher the text, then it may
be possible to intercept the shipping and redirect the babylon stone to
a safe location. i shall copy the shipping plan into my journal, and M
will return it before its absence is noted.
