variation on the ADFGVX cipher: block transposition is used instead of columnar transposition

permutation = (1,0,5,2,4,3)
    keyword = BABYLON if repeated letters are deleted

the square:

      A D F G V X
    A     s t o n
    D     e f g h
    F i j   k l m
    G p q r   u v
    V w x y z
    X a b c d

    since there are no digits in the plaintext, their placement is irrelevant

    keyword = STONE
