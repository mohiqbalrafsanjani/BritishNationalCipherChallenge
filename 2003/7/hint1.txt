Challenge seven - first clue

How are you getting on? Aggie threw you a curve ball with this one. It IS an ADFGVX cipher, but the standard way of writing out the cipher text is to work up the columns whereas Aggie seems to have worked across the rows instead. I figure she was nervous to use a standard German cipher with Germans on her tail. Any case, that should help. More later,
Harry
