Challenge Seven

Looks like we are coming to the end of this trail, Aunt Aggie has returned to Southampton, presumably to steal back the slab. Even after you translate the heiroglyphics back into English you still have a long way to go with this one, so I've done the translation for you. Click on the Journal to get the text version. By the way, the text begins AXGVF and finishes with DFAVX AA, just in case you can't see it all. Let us know if you have problems downloading it.

You can find out about the cipher Aunt Aggie has used, just look it up on the web or in the back of Simon Singh's book. It's a two stage cipher, and you have to decrypt it in two steps. Hell, why don't I make it easy for you and tell you what the keyword is for the first part of the decryption: BABYLON. After that you are on your own, at least for a while. More clues later.
