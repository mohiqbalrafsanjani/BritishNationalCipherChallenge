at last we have the babylon stone m arranged for the container to be opened
and the slab removed with all possible care and now it rests gently in a new
packing crate ready for its journey to new york

to impede the discovery of our action we have replaced the babylon stone
with a collection of rocks dredged from the dockside here in southampton
with luck by the time this devious deception is discovered we and the stone
will be resting far from here

payment of a mercifully small bribe secured the temporary distraction of the
night watchmen here in the docks and this was enough for us to gain access to
the bonded warehouse wherein the crate was stored working with a small team
of rogues recruited from local taverns we carried the babylon stone to another
warehouse where it was repackaged and labelled for onward shipment

we have just enough left to pay steerage class so that we may travel together
with the stone on the last stage of its journey we will depart next week

i must write to my sister before then as we have not met since i left for
egypt and it may be some time before i can tell her of my adventures in person
