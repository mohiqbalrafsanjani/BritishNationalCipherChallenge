april 12th southampton
dear sister

i am sending you this diary describing all my adventures in the hunt
for the babylon stone

fearing that my pursuers may catch up with us my heady confidence has
evaporated with the shocking discovery that my rivals have uncovered
our deception they have been making enquiries in local hotels though
their mistake has been to seek an english woman travelling with an
arab we smuggled m into my rooms in the grapes hotel here in oxford
street and for three days i have been disguised as a young man keeping
company with a crowd of passengers and crew here at the inn our boat
the titanic leaves in just a few minutes and i have persuaded my
drinking companions to leave at the last possible minute only when i
am sure that we have joined the babylon stone safely on board and have
not been followed will i feel truly safe

they say that this new liner is unsinkable and i wish i felt sure that
our mission too was assured of success but the many twists in the story
which you will find within this diary have left me wondering if the
legend of the curse of the babylon stone may have some basis in fact

i have not the time to write to jack i hear the boat whistle please
let him know that i could not be more grateful for the support of a
loving brother i will miss the company of you both in new york and
pray that you will be able to visit me before too long

now i must run

your loving sister
agatha
