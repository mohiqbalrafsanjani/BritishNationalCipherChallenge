Harry,

We are getting worried. We checked the dead drop on Thursday and
the back-up on Friday as arranged, but there were no instructions
from our handler. We were expecting to move on next week, but really
have no idea what to do now. Do we stay or run? We will check the
Honolulu Advertiser on Monday for any instructions, but if we don't
hear from you, I think we will go underground. Too many things going
bump in the night at the moment.

Yours,
Charlie and Marm
