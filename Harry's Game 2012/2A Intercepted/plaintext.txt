Sorry, guys. We have just received your postcard. Tempest have been
intercepting previous messages to you. We would advise you to keep a
lookout for anyone suspicious, as we just intercepted this message to
Tempest agents.

We are planning on moving you on Thursday to Kaunakakai on Moloka'i,
where we should be able to make you disappear from Tempest for long
enough to move you somewhere safe and set you up with completely new
identities. Go to the Coconut Bar and ask for Travis for further
instructions.
