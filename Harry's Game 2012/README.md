This was an extra series of challenges after the 2011 competition. Challenge 1 was
written by Harry, but the remainder were submitted by participants.

I do not know how long this series continued. I was only able to find challenges
1, 2A, 2B, 3B. There may be more.

The post announcing the game is copied into `post.txt`

Challenge 2B was submitted by EasyAs3.141.
