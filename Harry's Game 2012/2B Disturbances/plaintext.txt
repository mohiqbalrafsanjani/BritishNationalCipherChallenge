Attention Tempest agents

Current activities are going as forecast. The two disturbances have
been located in Honolulu and contact has been severed between them
and the intelligence services. The next stage of the operation is
ready to go, and all operatives should prepare for the next move to
suppress the threats.

Be advised that we have received reliable leaks that the targets may
still have some communication within British Intelligence with a
contact known as Harry, but this is yet to be fully confirmed.
